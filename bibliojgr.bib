	title = {Spatial patterns of visual cortical fast {EEG} during conditioned reflex in a rhesus monkey},
	volume = {422},
	issn = {0006-8993},
	abstract = {A preliminary assay was made of the existence of time-space coherence patterns of fast {EEG} activity in the visual cortex of a Rhesus monkey. The primary intent of the present study was to evaluate the similarities and differences in relation to the olfactory bulb, where such coherences have been described and have been demonstrated to be associated with behaviour. Segments 1.5 s in duration were recorded simultaneously without averaging from 16 to 35 subdural electrodes fixed over the left occipital lobe in an array 3.6 cm X 2.8 cm. Each segment was taken during the delivery of a visual conditioned stimulus ({CS)} and the performance of a conditioned response ({CR)} by a well-trained Rhesus monkey. The {EEGs} appeared chaotic with irregular bursts lasting 75-200 ms, resembling those in the olfactory {EEG} but with lower peak frequencies. Fourier spectra showed broad distributions of power resembling '1/f noise' with multiple peaks in the range of 20-40 Hz. Time intervals were selected where coherent activity seemed to be present at a number of electrodes. A dominant component waveform that was common to all channels was extracted by principal components analysis ({PCA)} of each segment. The distribution of the power of this component across the electrodes (the factor loadings) was used to describe the spatial pattern of the coherent cortical activity. Statistical analyses suggested that different patterns could be associated to the {CS} and the {CR}, as has been found in the olfactory system. These patterns remained stable over a 6 week recording interval. The patterns can be better discriminated, when the factor loadings of each channel are normalized to zero mean and unit variance, to discard a basic pattern of power distribution, which may reflect anatomical and electrode positioning factors that are related to behavioral information processing by the cortex. The wide spatial distribution of the common patterns found suggests that {EEG} patterns that manifest differing states of the visual cortex may also be accessible with scalp electrodes.},

@article{Seth:2008,
    abstract = {Neurons engage in causal interactions with one another and with the surrounding body and environment. Neural systems can therefore be analyzed in terms of causal networks, without assumptions about information processing, neural coding, and the like. Here, we review a series of studies analyzing causal networks in simulated neural systems using a combination of Granger causality analysis and graph theory. Analysis of a simple target-fixation model shows that causal networks provide intuitive representations of neural dynamics during behavior which can be validated by lesion experiments. Extension of the approach to a neurorobotic model of the hippocampus and surrounding areas identifies shifting causal pathways during learning of a spatial navigation task. Analysis of causal interactions at the population level in the model shows that behavioral learning is accompanied by selection of specific causal pathways-"causal cores"-from among large and variable repertoires of neuronal interactions. Finally, we argue that a causal network perspective may be useful for characterizing the complex neural dynamics underlying consciousness.},

In particular, we discuss how changes in the connectivity of a neural network affect the spatiotemporal network dynamics qualitatively. The three major criteria of comparison are, first, the local dynamics at the network nodes which includes fixed point dynamics, oscillatory and chaotic dynamics; second, the presence of time delays via propagation along connecting pathways; and third, the properties of the connectivity matrix such as its statistics, symmetry, and translational invariance. Since the connection topology changes when anatomical scales are traversed, so will the corresponding network dynamics change. As a consequence different types of networks are encountered on different levels of neural organization.},

    abstract = {Coupled biological and chemical systems, neural networks, social interacting species, the Internet and the World Wide Web, are only a few examples of systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical units. The first approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks' dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering.},

    abstract = {Neurons and neural populations do not function as islands onto themselves. Rather, they interact with other such elements through their afferent and efferent connections in an orchestrated manner so as to enable different sensorimotor and cognitive tasks to be performed. The concept of functional connectivity and the allied notion of effective connectivity were introduced to designate the functional strengths of such interactions. Functional neuroimaging methods, especially PET and fMRI, have been used extensively to evaluate the functional connectivity between different brain regions. After providing a brief historical review of these notions of brain connectivity, I argue that the conceptual formulations of functional and effective connectivity are far from clear. Specifically, the terms functional and effective connectivity are applied to quantities computed on types of functional imaging data (e.g., PET, fMRI, EEG) that vary in spatial, temporal, and other features, using different definitions (even for data of the same modality) and employing different computational algorithms. Until it is understood what each definition means in terms of an underlying neural substrate, comparisons of functional and/or effective connectivity across studies may appear inconsistent and should be performed with great caution.},

We attempt to characterize a wide variety of cortical connectivity data sets using a specific set of graph theory methods. We measure global aspects of cortical graphs including the abundance of small structural motifs such as cycles, the degree of local clustering of connections and the average path length. We examine large-scale cortical connection matrices obtained from neuroanatomical data bases, as well as probabilistic connection matrices at the level of small cortical neuronal populations linked by intra-areal and inter-areal connections. All cortical connection matrices examined in this study exhibit "small-world" attributes, characterized by the presence of abundant clustering of connections combined with short average distances between neuronal elements. We discuss the significance of these universal organizational features of cortex in light of functional brain anatomy.

It is focused on the phenomena of emergence, adaptive dynamics and evolution of self-assembling, self-organizing, self-maintaining and self-replicating biosynthetic systems viewed from a newly-arranged perspective and understanding of computation and communication in the living nature. The author regards this research as an integral part of the emerging discipline of nature-inspired or natural computation, i.e. computation inspired by or occurring in nature. Within this context, he is interested in studies which represent a significant departure from traditional theories about complex systems and self-organization, emergent phenomena and artificial biology. In particular, these include non-conventional approaches exploring the aggregation, composition, growth and development of physical forms and structures, autopoiesis along with the associated abstract information structures and processes. This paper provides a critical review of the major assumptions which guide the development of modern computer science and engineering towards emulating biological systems. For this purpose, the author explores the potential and the virtues of biology to reshape contemporary science. The goal of this survey is to discuss the present state of natural and engineering sciences in the light of a necessary paradigm change in the structure and methodology of research and deliver some insights for developing a new kind of integral science based on the principles for dynamic interdependence of the constituting disciplines and on the evolving relationships among them.},

However, such states have not been directly observed. For example, the hippocampal place cell representation of location was previously found to respond continuously to changes in environmental shape alone. We report that exposure to novel square and circular environments made of different materials creates attractor representations for both shapes: Place cells abruptly and simultaneously switch between representations as environmental shape changes incrementally. This enables study of attractor dynamics in a cognitive representation and may correspond to the formation of distinct contexts in context-dependent memory.

year = {2003},
abstract = {Networks of living neurons exhibit diverse patterns of activity, including oscillations, synchrony, and waves. Recent work in physics has shown yet another mode of activity in systems composed of many nonlinear units interacting locally. For example, avalanches, earthquakes, and forest fires all propagate in systems organized into a critical state in which event sizes show no characteristic scale and are described by power laws. We hypothesized that a similar mode of activity with complex emergent properties could exist in networks of cortical neurons. We investigated this issue in mature organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat cortex by recording spontaneous local field potentials continuously using a 60 channel multielectrode array. Here, we show that propagation of spontaneous activity in cortical networks is described by equations that govern avalanches. As predicted by theory for a critical branching process, the propagation obeys a power law with an exponent of -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching parameter close to the critical value of 1. Simulations show that a branching parameter at this value optimizes information transmission in feedforward networks, while preventing runaway network excitation. Our findings suggest that "neuronal avalanches" may be a generic property of cortical networks, and represent a mode of activity that differs profoundly from oscillatory, synchronized, or wave-like network states. In the critical state, the network may satisfy the competing demands of information transmission and network stability.

 @article{Buzsaki:2010,
abstract = {A widely discussed hypothesis in neuroscience is that transiently active ensembles of neurons, known as "cell assemblies," underlie numerous operations of the brain, from encoding memories to reasoning. However, the mechanisms responsible for the formation and disbanding of cell assemblies and temporal evolution of cell assembly sequences are not well understood. I introduce and review three interconnected topics, which could facilitate progress in defining cell assemblies, identifying their neuronal organization, and revealing causal relationships between assembly organization and behavior. First, I hypothesize that cell assemblies are best understood in light of their output product, as detected by "reader-actuator" mechanisms. Second, I suggest that the hierarchical organization of cell assemblies may be regarded as a neural syntax. Third, constituents of the neural syntax are linked together by dynamically changing constellations of synaptic weights ("synapsembles"). The existing support for this tripartite framework is reviewed and strategies for experimental testing of its predictions are discussed.},

The new science of Systems Biology claims to be able to solve the problem but I contend that this approach will fail because deducing models of function from the behaviour of a complex system is an inverse problem that is impossible to solve. In addition, one cannot easily escape into high-level holistic approaches, since the essence of all biological systems is that they are encoded as molecular descriptions in their genes and since genes are molecules and exert their functions through other molecules, the molecular explanation must constitute the core of understanding biological systems. We then solve the forward problem of computing the behaviour of the system from its components and their interactions. I propose that the correct level of abstraction is the cell and provide an outline of CELLMAP, a design for a system to organize biological information.},

@article{London:2010,
abstract = {It is well known that neural activity exhibits variability, in the sense that identical sensory stimuli produce different responses, but it has been difficult to determine what this variability means. Is it noise, or does it carry important information-about, for example, the internal state of the organism? Here we address this issue from the bottom up, by asking whether small perturbations to activity in cortical networks are amplified. Based on in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat barrel cortex, we find that a perturbation consisting of a single extra spike in one neuron produces approximately 28 additional spikes in its postsynaptic targets. We also show, using simultaneous intra- and extracellular recordings, that a single spike in a neuron produces a detectable increase in firing rate in the local network. Theoretical analysis indicates that this amplification leads to intrinsic, stimulus-independent variations in membrane potential of the order of +/-2.2-4.5 mV-variations that are pure noise, and so carry no information at all. Therefore, for the brain to perform reliable computations, it must either use a rate code, or generate very large, fast depolarizing events, such as those proposed by the theory of synfire chains. However, in our in vivo recordings, we found that such events were very rare. Our findings are thus consistent with the idea that cortex is likely to use primarily a rate code.},

@article{Friston:2001,
abstract = {The main point made in this article is that the representational capacity and inherent function of any neuron, neuronal population or cortical area is dynamic and context-sensitive. This adaptive and contextual specialisation is mediated by functional integration or interactions among brain systems with a special emphasis on backwards or top-down connections. The critical notion is that neuronal responses, in any given cortical area, can represent different things at different times. Our argument is developed under the perspective of generative models of functional brain architectures, where higher-level systems provide a prediction of the inputs to lower-level regions. Conflict between the two is resolved by changes in the higher-level representations, driven by the resulting error in lower regions, until the mismatch is 'cancelled'. In this model the specialisation of any region is determined both by bottom-up driving inputs and by top-down predictions. Specialisation is therefore not an intrinsic property of any region but depends on both forward and backward connections with other areas. Because these other areas have access to the context in which the inputs are generated they are in a position to modulate the selectivity or specialisation of lower areas. The implications for 'classical' models (e.g., classical receptive fields in electrophysiology, classical specialisation in neuroimaging and connectionism in cognitive models) are severe and suggest these models provide incomplete accounts of real brain architectures. Generative models represent a far more plausible framework for understanding selective neurophysiological responses and how representations are constructed in the brain.},

Systematic screening of 80+ potentially chemotactic compounds with two behavioral assays identified leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, cysteine, arginine and several peptides as strong chemoattractants. Deletion analysis of a number of potential halobacterial transducer genes led to the identification of Car, a specific cytoplasmic arginine transducer which lacks transmembrane helices and was biochemically shown to be localized in the cytoplasm. Flow assays were used to show specific adaptive responses to arginine and ornithine in wild-type but not Deltacar cells, demonstrating the role of Car in sensing arginine. The signaling pathway from external arginine to the flagellar motor of the cell involves an arginine:ornithine antiporter which was quantitatively characterized for its transport kinetics and inhibitors. By compiling the chemotactic behavior, the adaptive responses and the characteristics of the arginine:ornithine antiporter to arginine and its analogs, we now understand how the combination of arginine uptake and its metabolic conversion is required to build an effective sensing system. In both bacteria and the archaea this is the first chemoeffector molecule of a soluble methylatable transducer to be identified.},

Analyses of {cheR} and/or {cheB} mutants, defective in receptor methylation/demethylation, show that response sensitivity depends on the activity of {CheB} and the level of receptor modification. In {cheRcheB} mutants, the concentration of attractant that generates a half-maximal response is equal to the dissociation constant of the receptor. In wild-type cells, it is 35 times smaller.

They also sense gradients of attractants extending over five orders of magnitude in concentration (up to 1 {mM} aspartate). Here we consider the possibility that this combination of sensitivity and range of response depends on the clustering of chemotactic receptors on the surface of the bacterium. We examine what will happen if ligand binding changes the activity of a receptor, propagating this change in activity to neighbouring receptors in a cluster. Calculations based on these assumptions show that sensitivity to extracellular ligands increases with the extent of spread of activity through an array of receptors, but that the range of concentrations over which the array works is severely diminished. However, a combination of low threshold of response and wide dynamic range can be attained if the cell has both clusters and single receptors on its surface, particularly if the extent of activity spread can adapt to external conditions. A mechanism of this kind can account quantitatively for the sensitivity and response range of E. coli to aspartate.},

The adaptation property is a consequence of the network's connectivity and does not require the 'fine-tuning' of parameters.

	abstract = {Homeostasis is a specialized form of regulation that precisely maintains the function of a system at a set point level of activity. Recently, homeostatic signaling has been suggested to control neural activity through the modulation of synaptic efficacy and membrane excitability ( Davis \& Goodman 1998a, Turrigiano \& Nelson 2000, Marder \& Prinz 2002, {Perez-Otano} \& Ehlers 2005 ). In this way, homeostatic signaling is thought to constrain neural plasticity and contribute to the stability of neural function over time. Using a restrictive definition of homeostasis, this review first evaluates the phenomenological and molecular evidence for homeostatic signaling in the nervous system. Then, basic principles underlying the design and molecular implementation of homeostatic signaling are reviewed on the basis of work in other, simplified biological systems such as bacterial chemotaxis and the heat shock response. Data from these systems are then discussed in the context of homeostatic signaling in the nervous system.},

  abstract={Advanced information on the Prize in Economic Sciences 2002. Until recently, economics was widely regarded as a non-experimental science that had to rely on observation of real-world economies rather than controlled laboratory experiments. Many commentators also found restrictive the common assumption of a homo oeconomicus motivated by self-interest and capable of making rational decisions. But research in economics has taken off in new directions. A large and growing body of scientific work is now devoted to the empirical testing and modification of traditional postulates in economics, in particular those of unbounded rationality, pure self-interest, and complete self-control. Moreover, today's research increasingly relies on new data from laboratory experiments rather than on more traditional field data, that is, data obtained from observations of real economies. This recent research has its roots in two distinct, but converging, traditions: theoretical and empirical studies of human decision-making in cognitive psychology, and tests of predictions from economic theory by way of laboratory experiments. Today, behavioral economics and experimental economics are among the most active fields in economics, as measured by publications in major journals, new doctoral dissertations, seminars, workshops and conferences. This year's laureates are pioneers of these two fields of research.},

More often they are ever changing, showing perpetually novel behavior and emergent phenomena.

	abstract = {The Escherichia coli is a bacterium that comfortingly lives in the human gut and one of the best known living organisms. The sensitivity of this cell to environmental changes is reflected in two kind of movements that can be observed in a swimming bacterium: ârunâ towards an attractant, for example food, and âtumblingâ, in which a new direction is chosen randomly for the next ârunâ. This simple bimodal behavior of the E. coli constitutes in itself a paradigm of adaptation in which roboticists and cognitive psychologists have found inspiration. We present a new approach to synaptic plasticity in the nervous system by scrutinizing Escherichia coliâs motility and the signaling pathways that mediate its adaptive behavior. The formidable knowledge achieved in the last decade on bacterial chemotaxis, serve as the basis for a theory of a simple form of learning called habituation, that is applicable to biological and other systems. In this paper we try to establish a new framework that helps to explain what signals mean to the organisms, how these signals are integrated in patterns of behavior, and how they are sustained by an internal model of the world. The concepts of adaptation, synaptic plasticity and learning will be revisited within a new perspective, providing a quantitative basis for the understanding of how brains cope with a changing environment.},

The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention.

Temporally tagged segments can easily be utilized in neural systems and form a natural basis for object recognition and learning. The model consists of a âcorticalâ circuit, an array of units that act as local feature detectors. Units are formulated as neural oscillators. Knowledge relevant to segmentation is encoded by connections. In accord with simple Gestalt laws, our concrete model has intracolumnar connections, between all units with overlapping receptive fields, and intercolumnar connections, between units responding to the same quality in different positions. An inhibitory connection system prevents total correlation and controls the grain of the segmentation. In simulations with synthetic input data we show the performance of the circuit, which produces signal correlation within segments and anticorrelation between segments.},

	abstract = {Calcium is essential for normal cellular function. However, increases in cell calcium are also involved in cellular dysfunction and death by activating destructive enzymatic processes such as proteases, nucleases, and lipases. Since ionized hypocalcemia is common during sepsis, calcium is often administered in an attempt to normalize circulating levels. Previous studies using endotoxin and large amounts of calcium demonstrated increased mortality in calcium-treated animals. This study extends these preliminary data to endogenous sepsis (cecal ligation) and low dose calcium therapy. Sprague Dawley rats (n = 9 per group) had jugular catheters placed and their cecums ligated. They were randomized to an infusion of {D5W} at 1 ml/hr, calcium chloride at 4 mg/ml/hr {(Low} Ca), or calcium chloride at 6 mg/ml/hr {(High} Ca) for 24 hr. An additional group of animals received calcium chloride at 6 mg/ml/hr but had no surgery. Animals were followed for 24 hr survival. A separate group of animals (n = 6 per group) was prepared in a similar manner. Blood was obtained 6 hr following cecal ligation for circulating endotoxin concentrations, and animals were sacrificed. Calcium infusion increased ionized calcium levels slightly (low Ca, 1.12 +/- .06 to 1.21 +/- .09; high Ca, 1.06 +/- .04 to 1.16 +/- .05; P less than 0.05). Survival (24 hr) was 100\% in the nonseptic controls and {D5W} septic animals, 67\% in the low Ca septic group, and 44\% {(P} less than 0.05) in the high Ca septic {group.(ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 250 {WORDS)}},

Instead of defining health and disease states, the emphasis is on simplexes in a high-dimensional biomarker space. These simplexes are bounded by physiological constraints and permit the quantitative characterization of personalized health trajectories, health risk profiles that change with age, and the efficacy of different treatment options.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Local network connectivity disruptions in Alzheimer's disease patients have been found using graph analysis in {BOLD} {fMRI.} Other studies using {MEG} and cortical thickness measures, however, show more global long distance connectivity changes, both in functional and structural imaging data. The form and role of functional connectivity changes thus remains ambiguous. The current study shows more conclusive data on connectivity changes in early {AD} using graph analysis on resting-state condition {fMRI} data.


{METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}

18 mild {AD} patients and 21 healthy age-matched control subjects without memory complaints were investigated in resting-state condition with {MRI} at 1.5 Tesla. Functional coupling between brain regions was calculated on the basis of pair-wise synchronizations between regional time-series. Local (cluster coefficient) and global (path length) network measures were quantitatively defined. Compared to controls, the characteristic path length of {AD} functional networks is closer to the theoretical values of random networks, while no significant differences were found in cluster coefficient. The whole-brain average synchronization does not differ between Alzheimer and healthy control groups. Post-hoc analysis of the regional synchronization reveals increased {AD} synchronization involving the frontal cortices and generalized decreases located at the parietal and occipital regions. This effectively translates in a global reduction of functional long-distance links between frontal and caudal brain regions.


{CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE}

We present evidence of {AD-induced} changes in global brain functional connectivity specifically affecting long-distance connectivity. This finding is highly relevant for it supports the anterior-posterior disconnection theory and its role in {AD.} Our results can be interpreted as reflecting the randomization of the brain functional networks in {AD}, further suggesting a loss of global information integration in disease.},

Systems biology is an emerging field that enables us to achieve in-depth understanding at the system level. For this, we need to establish methodologies and techniques that enable us to understand biological systems as systems, which means to understand: (1) the structure of the system, such as gene/metabolic/signal transduction networks and physical structures, (2) the dynamics of such systems, (3) methods to control systems, and (4) methods to design and modify systems to generate desired properties. However, the meaning of "system-level understanding" is still ambiguous.

The concepts of feedback regulation and control of pathways and the coordination of cell function are emphasized as an important area of Systems Biology research. The hurdles and risks for this area are discussed from the perspective of dynamic pathway modelling. Most of all, the aim of this article is to promote mathematical modelling and simulation as a part of molecular- and cell biology.

	abstract = {The first systems analysis of the functioning of an organism was Claude Bernard's concept of the constancy of the internal environment (le milieu intÃ©rieur), since it implied the existence of control processes to achieve this. He can be regarded, therefore, as the first systems biologist. The new vogue for systems biology today is an important development, since it is time to complement reductionist molecular biology by integrative approaches. Claude Bernard foresaw that this would require the application of mathematics to biology. This aspect of Claude Bernard's work has been neglected by physiologists, which is why we are not as ready to contribute to the development of systems biology as we should be. In this paper, I outline some general principles that could form the basis of systems biology as a truly multilevel approach from a physiologist's standpoint. We need the insights obtained from higher-level analysis in order to succeed even at the lower levels. The reason is that higher levels in biological systems impose boundary conditions on the lower levels. Without understanding those conditions and their effects, we will be seriously restricted in understanding the logic of living systems. The principles outlined are illustrated with examples from various aspects of physiology and biochemistry. Applying and developing these principles should form a major part of the future of physiology.},

Systems with this property are called nearly completely decomposable, or more briefly, nearly decomposable {(ND).} The explanation for the ubiquity of the {ND} property is that, under the usual conditions of mutation and/or crossover and natural selection, {ND} systems will increase in fitness, and therefore reproduce, at a much faster rate than systems that do not possess the {ND} property.},

	abstract = {Owing to the exponential growth of genome databases, phylogenetic trees are now widely used to test a variety of evolutionary hypotheses. Nevertheless, computation time burden limits the application of methods such as maximum likelihood nonparametric bootstrap to assess reliability of evolutionary trees. As an alternative, the much faster Bayesian inference of phylogeny, which expresses branch support as posterior probabilities, has been introduced. However, marked discrepancies exist between nonparametric bootstrap proportions and Bayesian posterior probabilities, leading to difficulties in the interpretation of sometimes strongly conflicting results. As an attempt to reconcile these two indices of node reliability, we apply the nonparametric bootstrap resampling procedure to the Bayesian approach. The correlation between posterior probabilities, bootstrap maximum likelihood percentages, and bootstrapped posterior probabilities was studied for eight highly diverse empirical data sets and were also investigated using experimental simulation. Our results show that the relation between posterior probabilities and bootstrapped maximum likelihood percentages is highly variable but that very strong correlations always exist when Bayesian node support is estimated on bootstrapped character matrices. Moreover, simulations corroborate empirical observations in suggesting that, being more conservative, the bootstrap approach might be less prone to strongly supporting a false phylogenetic hypothesis. Thus, apparent conflicts in topology recovered by the Bayesian approach were reduced after bootstrapping. Both posterior probabilities and bootstrap supports are of great interest to phylogeny as potential upper and lower bounds of node reliability, but they are surely not interchangeable and cannot be directly compared.},

Indel events of any length are possible according to a geometric distribution. The geometric distribution parameter, the indel rate, and the evolutionary time are all maximum likelihood estimated from the sequences being aligned. Probability calculations are done using a pair hidden Markov model {(HMM)} with transition probabilities calculated from the indel parameters. Equations for the transition probabilities make the pair {HMM} closely approximate the specified indel model. The method provides an optimal alignment, its likelihood, the likelihood of all possible alignments, and the reliability of individual alignment regions. Human Î± and Î²-hemoglobin sequences are aligned, as an illustration of the potential utility of this pair {HMM} approach.},

However, the recent emergence of a large collection of unannotated transcripts with apparently little protein coding capacity, collectively called transcripts of unknown function {(TUFs)}, has begun to blur the physical boundaries and genomic organization of genic regions with noncoding transcripts often overlapping protein-coding genes on the same (sense) and opposite strand (antisense). Moreover, they are often located in intergenic regions, making the genic portions of the human genome an interleaved network of both annotated polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated transcripts, including splice variants with novel 5â² ends extending hundreds of kilobases. This complex transcriptional organization and other recently observed features of genomes argue for the reconsideration of the term âgeneâ and suggests that transcripts may be used to define the operational unit of a genome.},

In contrast, the complex patterns of dispersed regulation and pervasive transcription uncovered by the {ENCODE} project, together with non-genic conservation and the abundance of noncoding {RNA} genes, have challenged the notion of the gene. To illustrate this, we review the evolution of operational definitions of a gene over the past century--from the abstract elements of heredity of Mendel and Morgan to the present-day {ORFs} enumerated in the sequence databanks. We then summarize the current {ENCODE} findings and provide a computational metaphor for the complexity. Finally, we propose a tentative update to the definition of a gene: A gene is a union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. Our definition side-steps the complexities of regulation and transcription by removing the former altogether from the definition and arguing that final, functional gene products (rather than intermediate transcripts) should be used to group together entities associated with a single gene.

Further, three key questions are posed addressing to a mathematical theory.

While the theories of elaboration and transmission of information are valid mathematical theories, their own logic and implicit causal structure make them inimical to biology, and because of it, their applications have and are hindering the development of a sound theory of organisms.

Such exponential growth motivates us to ask how data analysis techniques are affected by progressively larger numbers of recorded neurons. Traditionally, neurons are analyzed independently on the basis of their tuning to stimuli or movement. Although tuning curve approaches are unaffected by growing numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons, newly developed techniques that analyze interactions between neurons become more accurate and more complex as the number of recorded neurons increases. Emerging data analysis techniques should consider both the computational costs and the potential for more accurate models associated with this exponential growth of the number of recorded neurons.},

These statistical tools are no longer the preserve of theorists and are being applied by experimental research groups in the analysis of empirical data. Although the relationship between information-theoretic and Fisher-based measures in the limit of infinite populations is relatively well understood, how these measures compare in finite-size populations has not yet been systematically explored. We aim to close this gap. We are particularly interested in understanding which stimuli are best encoded by a given neuron within a population and how this depends on the chosen measure. We use a novel Monte Carlo approach to compute a stimulus-specific decomposition of the mutual information (the {SSI)} for populations of up to 256 neurons and show that Fisher information can be used to accurately estimate both mutual information and {SSI} for populations of the order of 100 neurons, even in the presence of biologically realistic variability, noise correlations, and experimentally relevant integration times. According to both measures, the stimuli that are best encoded are those falling at the flanks of the neuron's tuning curve. In populations of fewer than around 50 neurons, however, Fisher information can be misleading.},

The immune system contains more than 107 different clones of cells that communicate via cell-cell contact and the secretion of molecules. Performing complex tasks such as learning and memory involves cooperation among large numbers of components of the immune system and hence there is interest in using methods and concepts from statistical physics. Furthermore, the immune response develops in time and the description of its time evolution is an interesting problem in dynamical systems. In this paper, the authors provide a brief introduction to the biology of the immune system and discuss a number of immunological problems in which the use of physical concepts and mathematical methods has increased our understanding.},

We discuss a statistical approach--approximate Bayesian computation {(ABC)--which} allows us to approximate the posterior distribution over parameters and show how this can add insights into our understanding of the system dynamics. We illustrate the application of this approach and how the resulting posterior distribution can be analyzed in the context of the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation cascade.

Ovulation rate at puberty was analyzed using an animal model with a batch effect. Prenatal survival was analyzed with a repeatability animal model that included batch and parity effects. Flat priors were used to represent vague previous knowledge about parity and batch effects. Additive and residual effects were represented assuming that they were a priori normally distributed. Variance components were assumed to follow either uniform or inverted chi-square distributions, a priori. The use of different priors did not affect the results substantially. Heritabilities for ovulation rate ranged from 0.32 to 0.39, and from 0.11 to 0.16 for prenatal survival, depending on the prior used.

In fact, the likelihood of the data under complex stochastic models is often analytically or numerically intractable in many areas of sciences. This makes it even more important to simultaneously investigate the adequacy of these modelsâin absolute terms, against the data, rather than relative to the performance of other modelsâbut no such procedure has been formally discussed when the likelihood is intractable. We provide a statistical interpretation to current developments in likelihood-free Bayesian inference that explicitly accounts for discrepancies between the model and the data, termed Approximate Bayesian Computation under model uncertainty {(ABCÎ¼).} We augment the likelihood of the data with unknown error terms that correspond to freely chosen checking functions, and provide Monte Carlo strategies for sampling from the associated joint posterior distribution without the need of evaluating the likelihood. We discuss the benefit of incorporating model diagnostics within an {ABC} framework, and demonstrate how this method diagnoses model mismatch and guides model refinement by contrasting three qualitative models of protein network evolution to the protein interaction datasets of Helicobacter pylori and Treponema pallidum. Our results make a number of model deficiencies explicit, and suggest that the T. pallidum network topology is inconsistent with evolution dominated by link turnover or lateral gene transfer alone.},

We examined how signal transmission is regulated in the macaque {LGN} by recording the retinal input to a single {LGN} neuron while stimulating the receptive field center with a naturalistic luminance sequence. After extracting the {EPSPs}, which are often partially merged with spike waveforms, we found that {\textgreater}95\% of spikes were associated with an {EPSP} from a single retinal ganglion cell. Each spike within a "burst" train was generated by an {EPSP}, indicating that {LGN} bursts are inherited from retinal bursts. {LGN} neurons rarely fired unless at least two {EPSPs} summated within 40 ms. This facilitation in {EPSP} efficacy was followed by depression. If a spike was generated by the first {EPSP} in a pair, it did not alter the efficacy of the second {EPSP.} Hence, the timing of {EPSPs} arising from the primary retinal driver governs synaptic efficacy and provides the basis for successful retinogeniculate transmission.},

	abstract = {Short-term changes in synaptic gain support information processing throughout the {CNS}, yet we know little about the developmental regulation of such plasticity. Here we report that auditory experience is necessary for the normal maturation of synaptic inhibitory short-term plasticity {(iSTP)} in the auditory cortex, and that presynaptic {GABAB} receptors regulate this development. Moderate or severe hearing loss was induced in gerbils, and {iSTP} was characterized by measuring inhibitory synaptic current amplitudes in response to repetitive stimuli. We reveal a profound developmental shift of {iSTP} from depressing to facilitating after the onset of hearing. Even moderate hearing loss prevented this shift. This {iSTP} change was mediated by a specific class of inhibitory interneurons, the low-threshold spiking cells. Further, using paired recordings, we reveal that presynaptic {GABAB} receptors at interneuron-pyramidal connections regulate {iSTP} in an experience-dependent manner. This novel synaptic mechanism may support the emergence of mature temporal processing in the auditory cortex.},

Networks of interacting molecules, such as transcription networks, have been shown to be composed of recurring circuits called network motifs, each with specific dynamical functions. Much less is known about the possibility of such circuit analysis in networks made of communicating cells. Here, we study models of circuits in which a few cell types interact by means of signaling molecules. We consider circuits of cells with architectures that seem to recur in immunology. An intriguing feature of these circuits is their use of signaling molecules with a pleiotropic or paradoxical role, such as cytokines that increase both cell growth and cell death. We find that pleiotropic signaling molecules can provide cell circuits with systems-level functions. These functions include for different circuits maintenance of homeostatic cell concentrations, robust regulation of differentiation processes, and robust pulses of cells or cytokines.},

We describe a probabilistic framework for gene structure and alignment that can be used to simultaneously find both the gene structure and alignment of two syntenic genomic regions. A key feature of the method is the ability to enhance gene predictions by finding the best alignment between two syntenic sequences, while at the same time finding biologically meaningful alignments that preserve the correspondence between coding exons. Our probabilistic framework is the generalized pair hidden Markov model, a hybrid of (1). generalized hidden Markov models, which have been used previously for gene finding, and (2). pair hidden Markov models, which have applications to sequence alignment. We have built a gene finding and alignment program called {SLAM}, which aligns and identifies complete exon/intron structures of genes in two related but unannotated sequences of {DNA.} {SLAM} is able to reliably predict gene structures for any suitably related pair of organisms, most notably with fewer false-positive predictions compared to previous methods (examples are provided for Homo {sapiens/Mus} musculus and Plasmodium {falciparum/Plasmodium} vivax comparisons). Accuracy is obtained by distinguishing conserved noncoding sequence {(CNS)} from conserved coding sequence. {CNS} annotation is a novel feature of {SLAM} and may be useful for the annotation of {UTRs}, regulatory elements, and other noncoding features.},

Most models in Systems Biology can easily be located within the space that is spanned by three dimensions of modeling: continuous and discrete; quantitative and qualitative; stochastic and deterministic. These dimensions are not entirely independent nor are they exclusive. Many modeling approaches are hybrid as they combine continuous and discrete, quantitative and qualitative, stochastic and deterministic aspects. Another important aspect for the distinction of modeling approaches is at which level a model describes a system: is it at the âmacro â level, at the âmicro â level, or at multiple levels of organization. Although multi-level models can be located anywhere in the space spanned by the three dimensions of modeling and simulation, clustering tendencies can be observed whose implications are discussed and illustrated by moving from a continuous, deterministic quantitative macro model to a stochastic discrete-event semi-quantitative multi-level model. 1},

This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and sensory evidence whose reliability varies over time. Our model predicts that the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex involved in evidence accumulation encode, on every trial, a probability distribution which predicts the animal's performance. We present experimental evidence consistent with this prediction and discuss other predictions applicable to more general settings.},

The principle calls for a model class whose representative assigns the largest probability or density to the observed data. Two examples of universal models for parametric classes \$\{\{\textbackslash\}cal M\}\$ are the normalized maximum likelihood {(NML)} model \{\textbackslash\}[ \{\textbackslash\}hat f (x\{\textasciicircum\}n\{\textbackslash\}mid\{\{\textbackslash\}cal M\})=f(x\{\textasciicircum\}n\{\textbackslash\}mid\{\textbackslash\}hat \{\textbackslash\}theta(x\{\textasciicircum\}n))\{\textbackslash\}bigg/\{\textbackslash\}int\_\{\textbackslash\}Omega f(y\{\textasciicircum\}n\{\textbackslash\}mid\{\textbackslash\}hat\{\textbackslash\}theta(y\{\textasciicircum\}n))\{\textbackslash\},\{\{\textbackslash\}rm d\}y\{\textasciicircum\}n, \{\textbackslash\}] where \$\{\textbackslash\}Omega\$ is an appropriately selected set, and a mixture \{\textbackslash\}[ f\_w(x\{\textasciicircum\}n\{\textbackslash\}mid \{\{\textbackslash\}cal M\})=\{\textbackslash\}int f(x\{\textasciicircum\}n\{\textbackslash\}mid\{\textbackslash\}theta)w(\{\textbackslash\}theta)\{\textbackslash\},\{\{\textbackslash\}rm d\}\{\textbackslash\}theta \{\textbackslash\}] as a convex linear functional of the models. In this interpretation a Bayes factor {\$B-f\_w(x\{\textasciicircum\}n\{\textbackslash\}mid\{\{\textbackslash\}cal} M\}\_1)/f\_v (x\{\textasciicircum\}n\{\textbackslash\}mid\{\{\textbackslash\}cal M\}\_2)\$ is the ratio of mixture representatives of two model classes. However, mixtures need not be the best representatives, and as will be shown the {NML} model provides a strictly better test for the mean being zero in the Gaussian cases where the variance is known or taken as a parameter.},

Six different types of primary wind-sensitive interneurons in the cricket cercal sensory system were tested for their sensitivity to the orientation and peak velocity of unidirectional airflow stimuli. 2. The cells could be grouped into two distinct classes on the basis of their thresholds and static sensitivities to airflow velocity. 3. Four interneurons (the right and left 10-2 cells and the right and left 10-3 cells) made up one of the two distinct velocity sensitivity classes. The mean firing frequencies of these interneurons were proportional to the logarithm of peak stimulus velocity over the range from 0.02 to 2.0 cm/s. 4. The other two interneurons studied (left and right 9-3) had a higher air-current velocity threshold, near the saturation level of the 10-2 and 10-3 interneurons. The slope of the velocity sensitivity curve for the 9-3 interneurons was slightly greater than that for the 10-2 and 10-3 interneurons, extending the sensitivity range of the system as a whole to at least 100 cm/s. 5. All of the interneurons had broad, symmetrical, single-lobed directional sensitivity tuning curves that could be accurately represented as truncated sine waves with 360 degree period. 6. The four low-threshold interneurons (i.e., left and right 10-2 and 10-3) had peak directional sensitivities that were evenly spaced around the horizontal plane, and their overlapping tuning curves covered all possible air-current stimulus orientations. The variance in the cells' responses to identical repeated stimuli varied between approximately 10\% at the optimal stimulus orientations and approximately 30\% at the zero-crossing orientations. 7. The two higher threshold interneurons (left and right 9-3) had broader directional sensitivity curves and wider spacing, resulting in reduced overlap with respect to the low-threshold class.},

Further insight can be gained by using information measures that are specific to particular stimuli or responses. The specific information is a previously proposed measure of the amount of information associated with a particular response; however, as I show, it does not properly characterize the amount of information associated with particular stimuli. Instead, I propose a new measure: the stimulus-specific information {(SSI)}, defined to be the average specific information of responses given the presence of a particular stimulus. Like other information theoretic measures, the {SSI} does not rely on assumptions about the neural code, and is robust to non-linearities of the system. To demonstrate its applicability, the {SSI} is applied to data from simulated visual neurons, and identifies stimuli consistent with the neuron's linear kernel. While the {SSI} reveals the essential linearity of the visual neurons, it also successfully identifies the well-encoded stimuli in a modified example where linear analysis techniques fail. Thus, I demonstrate that the {SSI} is an appropriate measure of the information associated with particular stimuli, and provides a new unbiased method of analysing the significant stimuli of a neural code.},

	abstract = {The default mode of brain function hypothesis and the presence of spontaneous intrinsic low-frequency signal fluctuations during rest have recently attracted attention in the neuroscience community. In this study we asked two questions: First, is it possible to attenuate intrinsic activity in the self-referential, default mode of brain function by directing the brains resources to a goal-oriented and attention-demanding task? Second, what effect does a sustained attention-demanding overt task performance have on the two intrinsically active networks in the brain, those being the task-negative, default-mode and the anticorrelated, task-positive network? We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor spontaneous intrinsic activity during rest and sustained performance of a sequential two-back working memory task. We compared intrinsic activity during rest and the two-back task to the signal increases and decreases observed in an epoch-related version of the working memory task. Our results show that spontaneous intrinsic activity in the default-mode network is not extinguished but rather attenuated during performance of the working memory task. Moreover, we show that the intrinsic activity in the task-positive network is reorganized in response to the working memory task. The results presented here complements earlier work that have shown that task-induced signal deactivations in the default-mode regions is modulated by cognitive load to also show that intrinsic, spontaneous signal fluctuations in the default-mode regions persist and reorganize in response to changes in external work load.},

However, the route to adult patterns of resting-state activity through neuronal development in the human brain is currently unknown. Therefore, we used functional {MRI} to map patterns of resting-state activity in infants during sleep. We found five unique resting-states networks in the infant brain that encompassed the primary visual cortex, bilateral sensorimotor areas, bilateral auditory cortex, a network including the precuneus area, lateral parietal cortex, and the cerebellum as well as an anterior network that incorporated the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that resting-state networks driven by spontaneous signal fluctuations are present already in the infant brain. The potential link between the emergence of behavior and patterns of resting-state activity in the infant brain is discussed.},

	abstract = {Research in many species has provided increasingly detailed information on relevant, primarily subcortical brain systems supporting the expression of basic appetites and drives. While basic appetites and drives are essential for adaptation and survival in any environment, they are naturally constrained by an organism's inherent biology and modulated as circumstances dictate. The brain mechanisms which serve to constrain and modulate them, however, remain much less well understood. We suggest that the manner in which such constraint and potential modulation is achieved likely involves processes that emerge from the coordinated behavior of multiple brain systems, and functional brain imaging techniques such as {PET} and {fMRI} are beginning to help us understand aspects of such coordination. In this review we argue that, in pursuit of this understanding, we must focus not only on changes evoked in brain systems during various behaviors, but also on the ongoing and very costly intrinsic activity within these systems, for the latter may be at least as important as the evoked activity in terms of brain function in general and the constraint and modulation of basic appetites and drives in particular. Distinguishing intrinsic from evoked activity in the context of functional brain imaging experiments is challenging, however. Here we review some evolving strategies for doing so. J. Comp.

Information on structural networks in the brain can be obtained in-vivo by performing tractography on diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} data. However, little is known about the reproducibility of network properties derived from whole brain tractography data, which has important consequences for minimally detectable abnormalities or changes over time. Moreover, acquisition parameters, such as the number of gradient directions and gradient strength, possibly influence network metrics and the corresponding reproducibility derived from tractography data. The aim of the present study is twofold: (i) to determine the effect of several clinically available {DTI} sampling schemes, differing in number of gradient directions and gradient amplitude, on small world metrics and (ii) to evaluate the interscan reproducibility of small world metrics. {DTI} experiments were conducted on six healthy volunteers scanned twice. Probabilistic tractography was performed to reconstruct structural connections between regions defined from an anatomical atlas. The observed reproducibility of the network measures was high, reflected by low values for the coefficient of variation ({\textless}3.8\%), advocating the use of graph theoretical measurements to study neurological diseases. Small world metrics were dependent on the choice of {DTI} gradient scheme and showed stronger connectivity with increasing directional resolution. The interscan reproducibility was not dependent on the gradient scheme. These findings should be considered when comparing results across studies using different gradient schemes or designing new studies.},

Here, we examined whether this functional organization is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease ({AD).} Task-free {fMRI} data from 21 {AD} subjects and 18 age-matched controls were obtained. Wavelet analysis was applied to the {fMRI} data to compute frequency-dependent correlation matrices. Correlation matrices were thresholded to create 90-node undirected-graphs of functional brain networks. Small-world metrics (characteristic path length and clustering coefficient) were computed using graph analytical methods. In the low frequency interval 0.01 to 0.05 Hz, functional brain networks in controls showed small-world organization of brain activity, characterized by a high clustering coefficient and a low characteristic path length. In contrast, functional brain networks in {AD} showed loss of small-world properties, characterized by a significantly lower clustering coefficient (p{\textless}0.01), indicative of disrupted local connectivity. Clustering coefficients for the left and right hippocampus were significantly lower (p{\textless}0.01) in the {AD} group compared to the control group. Furthermore, the clustering coefficient distinguished {AD} participants from the controls with a sensitivity of 72\% and specificity of 78\%. Our study provides new evidence that there is disrupted organization of functional brain networks in {AD.} Small-world metrics can characterize the functional organization of the brain in {AD}, and our findings further suggest that these network measures may be useful as an imaging-based biomarker to distinguish {AD} from healthy aging., Alzheimer's disease ({AD)} is a brain disorder characterized by progressive impairment of episodic memory and other cognitive domains resulting in dementia and, ultimately, death. Functional neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions that show abnormal brain function in {AD.} Although there is converging evidence about the identity of these regions, it is not clear how this abnormality affects the functional organization of the whole brain. In order to characterize the functional organization of the brain, our approach uses small-world measures, which have also been used to study systems such as social networks and the internet. We use graph analytical methods to compute these measures of functional connectivity brain networks, which are derived from {fMRI} data obtained from healthy elderly controls and {AD} patients. The {AD} patients had significantly lower regional connectivity, and showed disrupted global functional organization, when compared to healthy controls. Moreover, our results indicate that cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients is associated with disrupted functional connectivity in the entire brain. Our findings further suggest that small-world measures may be useful as an imaging-based biomarker to distinguish {AD} from healthy aging.},

	abstract = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by dense local clustering or cliquishness of connections between neighboring nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes due to the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This is an attractive model for the organization of brain anatomical and functional networks because a small-world topology can support both segregated/specialized and distributed/integrated information processing. Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to minimize wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors introduce some of the key mathematical concepts in graph theory required for small-world analysis and review how these methods have been applied to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from anatomical tract-tracing studies in the macaque monkey and the cat. The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a selection pressure to deliver cost-effective information-processing systems. The authors illustrate how these techniques and concepts are increasingly being applied to the analysis of human brain functional networks derived from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography and {fMRI} experiments. Finally, the authors consider the relevance of small-world models for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors and the resilience of brain systems to pathological attack by disease or aberrant development. They conclude that small-world models provide a powerful and versatile approach to understanding the structure and function of human brain systems.},

Advances in the analysis of complex networks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and functional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks recently described allow their characterization as small-world, random (exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that have been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology, hodology, clustering and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network analysis methods to cortical interareal connectivity networks for the cat and macaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark rewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks using two analysis strategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and connections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The structural decay of the brain networks is in most respects similar to that of scale-free networks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck connections as a structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain systems. This informs the understanding of the development of connectivity of the brain networks.},

	abstract = {The human brain has been described as a large, sparse, complex network characterized by efficient small-world properties, which assure that the brain generates and integrates information with high efficiency. Many previous neuroimaging studies have provided consistent evidence of 'dysfunctional connectivity' among the brain regions in schizophrenia; however, little is known about whether or not this dysfunctional connectivity causes disruption of the topological properties of brain functional networks. To this end, we investigated the topological properties of human brain functional networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI).} Data was obtained from 31 schizophrenia patients and 31 healthy subjects; then functional connectivity between 90 cortical and sub-cortical regions was estimated by partial correlation analysis and thresholded to construct a set of undirected graphs. Our findings demonstrated that the brain functional networks had efficient small-world properties in the healthy subjects; whereas these properties were disrupted in the patients with schizophrenia. Brain functional networks have efficient small-world properties which support efficient parallel information transfer at a relatively low cost. More importantly, in patients with schizophrenia the small-world topological properties are significantly altered in many brain regions in the prefrontal, parietal and temporal lobes. These findings are consistent with a hypothesis of dysfunctional integration of the brain in this illness. Specifically, we found that these altered topological measurements correlate with illness duration in schizophrenia. Detection and estimation of these alterations could prove helpful for understanding the pathophysiological mechanism as well as for evaluation of the severity of schizophrenia.},

Across healthy individuals, nodes within each functional network exhibited tightly correlated gray matter volumes.

These nexuses are intriguing because of their potential role in integration and also because they may augment metabolic cascades relevant to brain disease. To identify regions of high connectivity in the human cerebral cortex, we applied a computationally efficient approach to map the degree of intrinsic functional connectivity across the brain. Analysis of two separate functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets (each n = 24) demonstrated hubs throughout heteromodal areas of association cortex. Prominent hubs were located within posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, lateral parietal, and medial/lateral prefrontal cortices. Network analysis revealed that many, but not all, hubs were located within regions previously implicated as components of the default network. A third dataset (n = 12) demonstrated that the locations of hubs were present across passive and active task states, suggesting that they reflect a stable property of cortical network architecture. To obtain an accurate reference map, data were combined across 127 participants to yield a consensus estimate of cortical hubs. Using this consensus estimate, we explored whether the topography of hubs could explain the pattern of vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease ({AD)} because some models suggest that regions of high activity and metabolism accelerate pathology. Positron emission tomography amyloid imaging in {AD} (n = 10) compared with older controls (n = 29) showed high amyloid-beta deposition in the locations of cortical hubs consistent with the possibility that hubs, while acting as critical way stations for information processing, may also augment the underlying pathological cascade in {AD.}},

Experimental work shows that these properties vary considerably across identified neurons in different animals. Given this variability in experimental data, this review describes some of the complications of building computational models to aid in understanding how system dynamics arise from the interaction of system components. We argue that instead of trying to build a single model that captures the generic behavior of a neuron or circuit, it is beneficial to construct a population of models that captures the behavior of the population that provided the experimental data. Studying a population of models with different underlying structure and similar behaviors provides opportunities to discover unsuspected compensatory mechanisms that contribute to neuron and network function.

Robustness has two components, a measure of the causal contribution of a node or nodes, and a measure of the change or exclusion dependence, of the network following node removal. Causality is measured as statistical contribution of a node to network function, whereas exclusion dependence measures a distance between unperturbed network and reconfigured network function. We explore the role that redundancy plays in increasing robustness, and how redundacy can be exploited through error-correcting codes implemented by networks. We provide examples of the robustness measure when applied to familiar boolean functions such as the {AND}, {OR} and {XOR} functions. We discuss the relationship between robustness measures and related measures of complexity and how robustness always implies a minimal level of complexity.},

	abstract = {Homeostasis is a basic tenet of biomedicine and an open problem for many physiological control systems. Among them, none has been more extensively studied and intensely debated than the dilemma of exercise hyperpnea â a paradoxical homeostatic increase of respiratory ventilation that is geared to metabolic demands instead of the normal chemoreflex mechanism. Classical control theory has led to a plethora of âfeedback/feedforward controlâ or âset pointâ hypotheses for homeostatic regulation, yet so far none of them has proved satisfactory in explaining exercise hyperpnea and its interactions with other respiratory inputs. Instead, the available evidence points to a far more sophisticated respiratory controller capable of integrating multiple afferent and efferent signals in adapting the ventilatory pattern toward optimality relative to conflicting homeostatic, energetic and other objectives. This optimality principle parsimoniously mimics exercise hyperpnea, chemoreflex and a host of characteristic respiratory responses to abnormal gas exchange or mechanical loading/unloading in health and in cardiopulmonary diseases â all without resorting to a feedforward âexercise stimulusâ. Rather, an emergent controller signal encoding the projected metabolic level is predicted by the principle as an exercise-induced âmental perceptâ or âinternal modelâ, presumably engendered by associative learning (operant conditioning or classical conditioning) which achieves optimality through continuous identification of, and adaptation to, the causal relationship between respiratory motor output and resultant chemical-mechanical afferent feedbacks. This internal model self-tuning adaptive control paradigm opens a new challenge and exciting opportunity for experimental and theoretical elucidations of the mechanisms of respiratory control â and of homeostatic regulation and sensorimotor integration in general.},

Whilst whole brain measures of organization did not differ between groups, a significant rearrangement of their community structure was observed. Furthermore we were able to classify individuals with a high level of accuracy using a support vector machine, primarily through the use of a modularity-based metric known as the participation {index.In} conclusion, the application of machine learning techniques to features of resting state {fMRI} network activity shows promising potential to assist in the diagnosis of major depression, now suggesting the need for validation in independent data sets.},

While {fcMRI} does not provide direct measurement of anatomic connectivity, accumulating evidence suggests it is sufficiently constrained by anatomy to allow the architecture of distinct brain systems to be characterized. {fcMRI} is particularly useful for characterizing large-scale systems that span distributed areas (e.g., polysynaptic cortical pathways, cerebro-cerebellar circuits, cortical-thalamic circuits) and has complementary strengths when contrasted with the other major tool available for human connectomicsâhigh angular resolution diffusion imaging ({HARDI).} We review what is known about {fcMRI} and then explore {fcMRI} data reliability, effects of preprocessing, analysis procedures, and effects of different acquisition parameters across six studies (n = 98) to provide recommendations for optimization. Run length (2â12 min), run structure (1 12-min run or 2 6-min runs), temporal resolution (2.5 or 5.0 s), spatial resolution (2 or 3 mm), and the task (fixation, eyes closed rest, eyes open rest, continuous word-classification) were varied. Results revealed moderate to high test-retest reliability. Run structure, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution minimally influenced {fcMRI} results while fixation and eyes open rest yielded stronger correlations as contrasted to other task conditions. Commonly used preprocessing steps involving regression of nuisance signals minimized nonspecific (noise) correlations including those associated with respiration. The most surprising finding was that estimates of correlation strengths stabilized with acquisition times as brief as 5 min. The brevity and robustness of {fcMRI} positions it as a powerful tool for large-scale explorations of genetic influences on brain architecture. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of {fcMRI} and how it can be combined with {HARDI} techniques to support the emerging field of human connectomics.},

	abstract = {Functional {MRI} ({fMRI)} can be applied to study the functional connectivity of the human brain. It has been suggested that fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent ({BOLD)} signal during rest reflect the neuronal baseline activity of the brain, representing the state of the human brain in the absence of goal-directed neuronal action and external input, and that these slow fluctuations correspond to functionally relevant resting-state networks. Several studies on resting {fMRI} have been conducted, reporting an apparent similarity between the identified patterns. The spatial consistency of these resting patterns, however, has not yet been evaluated and quantified. In this study, we apply a data analysis approach called tensor probabilistic independent component analysis to resting-state {fMRI} data to find coherencies that are consistent across subjects and sessions. We characterize and quantify the consistency of these effects by using a bootstrapping approach, and we estimate the {BOLD} amplitude modulation as well as the voxel-wise cross-subject variation. The analysis found 10 patterns with potential functional relevance, consisting of regions known to be involved in motor function, visual processing, executive functioning, auditory processing, memory, and the so-called default-mode network, each with {BOLD} signal changes up to 3\%. In general, areas with a high mean percentage {BOLD} signal are consistent and show the least variation around the mean. These findings show that the baseline activity of the brain is consistent across subjects exhibiting significant temporal dynamics, with percentage {BOLD} signal change comparable with the signal changes found in task-related experiments.},

Further, auditory hallucinations occur across a range of healthy and disease states that include reduced arousal, hypnosis, drug intoxication, delirium, and psychosis. This suggests that, even in health, the auditory cortex has a propensity to spontaneously "activate" during silence. Here we report the findings of a functional {MRI} study, designed to examine baseline activity in speech-sensitive auditory regions. During silence, we show that functionally defined speech-sensitive auditory cortex is characterized by intermittent episodes of significantly increased activity in a large proportion (in some cases {\textgreater}30\%) of its volume. Bilateral increases in activity are associated with foci of spontaneous activation in the left primary and association auditory cortices and anterior cingulate cortex. We suggest that, within auditory regions, endogenous activity is modulated by anterior cingulate cortex, resulting in spontaneous activation during silence. Hence, an aspect of the brain's "default mode" resembles a (preprepared) substrate for the development of auditory hallucinations. These observations may help explain why such hallucinations are ubiquitous.},

	abstract = {Functional connectivity among brain regions has been investigated via an analysis of correlations between regional signal fluctuations recorded in magnetic resonance ({MR)} images obtained in a steady state. In comparison with studies of functional connectivity that utilize task manipulations, the analysis of correlations in steady state data is less susceptible to confounds arising when functionally unrelated brain regions respond in similar ways to changes in task. A new approach to identifying interregional correlations in steady state data makes use of two independent data sets. Regions of interest ({ROIs)} are defined and hypotheses regarding their connectivity are generated in one data set. The connectivity hypotheses are then evaluated in the remaining (independent) data set by analyzing low frequency temporal correlations between regions. The roles of the two data sets are then reversed and the process repeated, perhaps multiple times. This method was illustrated by application to the language system. The existence of a functional connection between Broca's area and Wernicke's area was confirmed in healthy subjects at rest. An increase in this functional connection when the language system was actively engaged (when subjects were continuously listening to narrative text) was also confirmed. In a second iteration of analyses, a correlation between Broca's area and a region in left premotor cortex was found to be significant at rest and to increase during continuous listening. These findings suggest that the proposed methodology can reveal the presence and strength of functional connections in high-level cognitive systems.},

An important question is whether this functional organization emerges only in response to external attentional demands or is represented more fundamentally in the internal dynamics of brain activity. To address this question, we examine correlations in spontaneous fluctuations of the functional {MRI} blood oxygen level-dependent signal in the absence of task, stimuli, or explicit attentional demands. We identify a bilateral dorsal attention system and a right-lateralized ventral attention system solely on the basis of spontaneous activity. Further, we observe regions in the prefrontal cortex correlated with both systems, a potential mechanism for mediating the functional interaction between systems. These findings demonstrate that the neuroanatomical substrates of human attention persist in the absence of external events, reflected in the correlation structure of spontaneous activity.},

Here spontaneous blood-oxygenation-level-dependent ({BOLD)} signal correlations were used in three separate functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets (n = 105) to define a third system, the frontoparietal control system, which is spatially interposed between these two previously defined systems. The frontoparietal control system includes many regions identified as supporting cognitive control and decision-making processes including lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule. Detailed analysis of frontal and parietal cortex, including use of high-resolution data, revealed clear evidence for contiguous but distinct regions: in general, the regions associated with the frontoparietal control system are situated between components of the dorsal attention and hippocampal-cortical memory systems. The frontoparietal control system is therefore anatomically positioned to integrate information from these two opposing brain systems.},

	abstract = {Resting state functional connectivity, which is defined as temporal correlation of spontaneous activity between diverse brain regions, has been reported to form resting state networks ({RSNs)}, consisting of a specific set of brain regions, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI).} Recently, studies using near-infrared spectroscopy ({NIRS)} reported that {NIRS} signals also show temporal correlation between different brain regions. The local relationship between {NIRS} and {fMRI} signals has been examined by simultaneously recording these signals when participants perform tasks or respond to stimuli. However, the {NIRS-fMRI} signal relationship during the resting state has been reported only between {NIRS} signals obtained within limited regions and whole brain {fMRI} signals. Therefore, it remains unclear whether {NIRS} signals obtained at diverse regions correlate with regional {fMRI} signals close to the {NIRS} measurement channels, especially in relation to the {RSNs.} In this study, we tested whether the signals measured by these different modalities during the resting state have the consistent characteristics of the {RSNs.} Specifically, {NIRS} signals during the resting state were acquired over the frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices while whole brain {fMRI} data was simultaneously recorded. First, by projecting the {NIRS} channel positions over the cerebral cortical surface, we identified the most likely anatomical locations of all {NIRS} channels used in the study. Next, to investigate the regional signal relationship between {NIRS} and {fMRI}, we calculated the cross-correlation between {NIRS} signals and {fMRI} signals in the brain regions adjacent to each {NIRS} channel. For each {NIRS} channel, we observed the local maxima of correlation coefficients between {NIRS} and {fMRI} signals within a radius of 2 voxels from the projection point. Furthermore, we also found that highly correlated voxels with the {NIRS} signal were mainly localized within brain tissues for all {NIRS} channels, with the exception of 2 frontal channels. Finally, by calculating the correlation between {NIRS} signals at a channel and whole brain {fMRI} signals, we observed that {NIRS} signals correlate with {fMRI} signals not only within brain regions adjacent to {NIRS} channels but also within distant brain regions constituting {RSNs}, such as the dorsal attention, fronto-parietal control, and default mode networks. These results support the idea that {NIRS} signals obtained at several cortical regions during the resting state mainly reflect regional spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuations that originate from spontaneous cortical activity, and include information that characterizes the {RSNs.} Because {NIRS} is relatively easy to use and a less physically demanding neuroimaging technique, our findings should facilitate a broad application of this technique to examine {RSNs}, especially for clinical populations and conditions unsuitable for {fMRI.}},

For this purpose, we performed {BOLD} {fMRI} on normal subjects during varying levels of consciousness, from resting wakefulness to light (non-slow wave) sleep.

Nine consistently found functionally linked resting-state networks were retrieved from the resting-state data. The diffusion tensor imaging scans were used to reconstruct the white matter pathways between the functionally linked brain areas of these resting-state networks.

	abstract = {Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging ({fcMRI)} studies constitute a growing proportion of functional brain imaging publications. This approach detects temporal correlations in spontaneous blood oxygen levelâdependent ({BOLD)} signal oscillations while subjects rest quietly in the scanner. Although distinct resting-state networks related to vision, language, executive processing, and other sensory and cognitive domains have been identified, considerable skepticism remains as to whether resting-state functional connectivity maps reflect neural connectivity or simply track {BOLD} signal correlations driven by nonneural artifact. Here we combine diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} tractography with resting-state {fcMRI} to test the hypothesis that resting-state functional connectivity reflects structural connectivity. These 2 modalities were used to investigate connectivity within the default mode network, a set of brain regionsâincluding medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC)}, medial temporal lobes ({MTLs)}, and posterior cingulate cortex ({PCC)/retropslenial} cortex ({RSC)âimplicated} in episodic memory processing. Using seed regions from the functional connectivity maps, the {DTI} analysis revealed robust structural connections between the {MTLs} and the retrosplenial cortex whereas tracts from the {MPFC} contacted the {PCC} (just rostral to the {RSC).} The results demonstrate that resting-state functional connectivity reflects structural connectivity and that combining modalities can enrich our understanding of these canonical brain networks.},

	abstract = {Recent studies indicate that functional connectivity using low-frequency {BOLD} fluctuations ({LFBFs)} is reduced between the bilateral primary sensorimotor regions in multiple sclerosis. In addition, it has been shown that pathway-dependent measures of the transverse diffusivity of water in white matter correlate with related clinical measures of functional deficit in multiple sclerosis. Taken together, these methods suggest that {MRI} methods can be used to probe both functional connectivity and anatomic connectivity in subjects with known white matter impairment. We report the results of a study comparing anatomic connectivity of the transcallosal motor pathway, as measured with diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} and functional connectivity of the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices ({SMC)}, as measured with {LFBFs} in the resting state. High angular resolution diffusion imaging was combined with functional {MRI} to define the transcallosal white matter pathway connecting the bilateral primary {SMC.} Maps were generated from the probabilistic tracking employed and these maps were used to calculate the mean pathway diffusion measures fractional anisotropy {FA}, mean diffusivity {MD}, longitudinal diffusivity lambda(1), and transverse diffusivity lambda(2). These were compared with {LFBF-based} functional connectivity measures (F(c)) obtained at rest in a cohort of 11 multiple sclerosis patients and approximately 10 age- and gender-matched control subjects. The correlation between {FA} and F(c) for {MS} patients was r = -0.63, P {\textless} 0.04. The correlation between all subjects lambda(2) and F(c) was r = 0.42, P {\textless} 0.05. The correlation between all subjects lambda(2) and F(c) was r = -0.50, P {\textless} 0.02. None of the control subject correlations were significant, nor were {FA}, lambda(1), or {MD} significantly correlated with F(c) for {MS} patients.

Small-world networks, such as the brain, combine optimal properties of both ordered and random networks, i.e., high clustering and short path lengths. We used graph theoretical concepts to examine changes in functional brain networks during normal development in young children. Resting-state eyes-closed electroencephalography ({EEG)} was recorded (14 channels) from 227 children twice at 5 and 7 years of age. Synchronization likelihood ({SL)} was calculated in three different frequency bands and between each pair of electrodes to obtain {SL-weighted} graphs. Mean normalized clustering index, average path length and weight dispersion were calculated to characterize network organization. Repeated measures analysis of variance tested for time and gender effects. For all frequency bands mean {SL} decreased from 5 to 7 years. Clustering coefficient increased in the alpha band. Path length increased in all frequency bands. Mean normalized weight dispersion decreased in beta band. Girls showed higher synchronization for all frequency bands and a higher mean clustering in alpha and beta bands. The overall decrease in functional connectivity ({SL)} might reflect pruning of unused synapses and preservation of strong connections resulting in more cost-effective networks. Accordingly, we found increases in average clustering and path length and decreased weight dispersion indicating that normal brain maturation is characterized by a shift from random to more organized small-world functional networks. This developmental process is influenced by gender differences early in development.},

This baseline is characterized by slow ({\textless}0.1 Hz) fluctuations of functional imaging signals that are topographically organized in discrete brain networks, and by much faster (1â80 Hz) electrical oscillations. To investigate the relationship between hemodynamic and electrical oscillations, we have adopted a completely data-driven approach that combines information from simultaneous electroencephalography ({EEG)} and functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI).} Using independent component analysis on the {fMRI} data, we identified six widely distributed resting state networks. The blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations associated with each network were correlated with the {EEG} power variations of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma rhythms. Each functional network was characterized by a specific electrophysiological signature that involved the combination of different brain rhythms. Moreover, the joint {EEG/fMRI} analysis afforded a finer physiological fractionation of brain networks in the resting human brain. This result supports for the first time in humans the coalescence of several brain rhythms within large-scale brain networks as suggested by biophysical studies.},

	abstract = {A baseline or control state is fundamental to the understanding of most complex systems. Defining a baseline state in the human brain, arguably our most complex system, poses a particular challenge. Many suspect that left unconstrained, its activity will vary unpredictably. Despite this prediction we identify a baseline state of the normal adult human brain in terms of the brain oxygen extraction fraction or {OEF.} The {OEF} is defined as the ratio of oxygen used by the brain to oxygen delivered by flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in the awake but resting state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed). Local deviations in the {OEF} represent the physiological basis of signals of changes in neuronal activity obtained with functional {MRI} during a wide variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative metabolic and circulatory measurements from positron-emission tomography to obtain the {OEF} regionally throughout the brain. Areas of activation were conspicuous by their absence. All significant deviations from the mean hemisphere {OEF} were increases, signifying deactivations, and resided almost exclusively in the visual system. Defining the baseline state of an area in this manner attaches meaning to a group of areas that consistently exhibit decreases from this baseline, during a wide variety of goal-directed behaviors monitored with positron-emission tomography and functional {MRI.} These decreases suggest the existence of an organized, baseline default mode of brain function that is suspended during specific goal-directed behaviors.},

The objective of the present study was, therefore, to investigate the {DMN} in patients seeking help from specialized mental health services for the first time for symptoms of {depression.Methods:} Fourteen depressed subjects and 15 matched controls were scanned using 4-T functional magnetic resonance imaging while resting with eyes closed.

Direct comparison showed significantly reduced correlation between the {P/PCC} and the bilateral caudate in depression compared with controls and no areas of increased connectivity in the depressed {group.Conclusions:} The present study is the first to investigate resting-state {DMN} in the early stages of treatment-seeking for depression. Depressed subjects had decreased connectivity between the {P/PCC} and the bilateral caudate, regions known to be involved in motivation and reward processing.

	issn = {0195-6108},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE}
In subjects who are performing no prescribed cognitive task, functional connectivity mapped with {MR} imaging ({fcMRI)} shows regions with synchronous fluctuations of cerebral blood flow. When specific tasks are performed, functional {MR} imaging ({fMRI)} can map locations in which regional cerebral blood flow increases synchronously with the performance of the task. We tested the hypothesis that {fcMRI} maps, based on the synchrony of low-frequency blood flow fluctuations, identify brain regions that show activation on {fMRI} maps of sensorimotor, visual, language, and auditory tasks.
{METHODS}
In four volunteers, task-activation {fMRI} and functional connectivity (resting-state) {fcMRI} data were acquired. A small region of interest (in an area that showed maximal task activation) was chosen, and the correlation coefficient of the corresponding resting-state signal with the signal of all other voxels in the resting data set was calculated. The correlation coefficient was decomposed into frequency components and its distribution determined for each {fcMRI} map. The {fcMRI} maps were compared with the {fMRI} maps.
{RESULTS}
For each task, {fcMRI} maps based on one to four seed voxel(s) produced clusters of voxels in regions of eloquent cortex. For each {fMRI} map a closely corresponding {fcMRI} map was obtained. The frequencies that predominated in the cross-correlation coefficients for the functionally related regions were below 0.1 Hz.
{CONCLUSION}
Functionally related brain regions can be identified by means of their synchronous slow fluctuations in signal intensity. Such blood flow synchrony can be detected in sensorimotor areas, expressive and receptive language regions, and the visual cortex by {fcMRI.} Regions identified by the slow synchronous fluctuations are similar to those activated by motor, language, or visual tasks.},

Previous studies have shown that the primary function subserved by the default mode is that of an introspectively oriented, self-referential mode of mental activity. The default mode of brain function hypothesis is readdressed from the perspective of the presence of low-frequency blood oxygenation level-dependent ({BOLD)} functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} signal changes (0.012-0.1 Hz) in the resting brain. The results show that the brain during rest is not tonically active in a single mode of brain function. Rather, the findings presented here suggest that the brain recurrently toggles between an introspectively oriented mode (default mode) and a state-of-mind that tentatively might be interpreted as an extrospectively oriented mode that involves a readiness and alertness to changes in the external and internal environment.},

In order to investigate further these fluctuations, we have characterized their spatial and temporal properties using probabilistic independent component analysis ({PICA)}, a robust approach to {RSN} identification. Here, we provide evidence that: i. {RSNs} are not caused by signal artifacts due to low sampling rate (aliasing); ii. they are localized primarily to the cerebral cortex; iii. similar {RSNs} also can be identified in perfusion {fMRI} data; and iv. at least 5 distinct {RSN} patterns are reproducible across different subjects.

The majority of the most discriminating functional connections were located within or across the default mode network, affective network, visual cortical areas and cerebellum, thereby indicating that the disease-related resting-state network alterations may give rise to a portion of the complex of emotional and cognitive disturbances in major depression. Moreover, the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, which exhibit high discriminative power in classification, may play important roles in the pathophysiology of this disorder. The current study may shed new light on the pathological mechanism of major depression and suggests that whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging may provide potential effective biomarkers for its clinical diagnosis.},

Our approach avoids the introduction of user-defined seed regions for the study of spontaneous activity. Unlike existing techniques, it yields a sparse representation of resting-state activity networks which can be characterized and investigated fairly easily in a semi-interactive fashion. We proceed in several steps, based on the idea that spectral coherence of the {fMRI} time courses in the low frequency band carries the information of interest. In particular, we address the question of building adapted representations of the data from the spectral coherence matrix. We analyze nine datasets taken from three subjects and show resting-state networks validated by {EEG-fMRI} simultaneous acquisition literature, with low intra-subject variability; we also discuss the merits of different (rapid/slow) {fMRI} acquisition schemes.},

One observation is that a network of regions, referred to as the default network, shows preferentially greater activity during passive task states as compared to a wide range of active tasks. The second observation is that distributed regions spontaneously increase and decrease their activity together within functional-anatomic networks, even under anesthesia. We believe these rest activity patterns may reflect neural functions that consolidate the past, stabilize brain ensembles, and prepare us for the future. Accumulating data further suggest that differences in rest activity may be relevant to understanding clinical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and autism. Maps of spontaneous network correlations also provide tools for functional localization and study of comparative anatomy between primate species. For all of these reasons, we advocate the systematic exploration of rest activity.},

The amount of reduction was estimated by an improved method that utilizes a first-order autoregressive fitting technique to the {PCA} spectrum. Analyses were performed using all sessions in order to maximize sensitivity and alleviate the problem of component identification across session. Across-session consistency was examined by three methods, all using back-reconstruction of the single session or single subject/session maps from the grand (5 session) maps. The {gICA} analysis produced 55 spatially independent maps. Obvious artifactual maps were eliminated and the remainder were grouped based upon physiological recognizability. Biologically relevant component maps were found, including sensory, motor and a âdefault-modeâ map. All analysis methods showed that components were remarkably consistent across session. Critically, the components with the most obvious physiological relevance were the most consistent. The consistency of these maps suggests that, at least over a period of several weeks, these networks would be useful to follow longitudinal treatment-related manipulations.},

Here, we used resting-state functional {MRI} ({fMRI)} to investigate the influences of different brain parcellation atlases on the topological organization of brain functional networks. Whole-brain {fMRI} data were divided into ninety and seventy regions of interest according to two predefined anatomical atlases, respectively. Brain functional networks were constructed by thresholding the correlation matrices among the parcellated regions and further analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Both atlas-based brain functional networks were found to show robust small-world properties and truncated power-law connectivity degree distributions, which are consistent with previous brain functional and structural networks studies. However, more importantly, we found that there were significant differences in multiple topological parameters (e.g., small-worldness and degree distribution) between the two groups of brain functional networks derived from the two atlases. This study provides quantitative evidence on how the topological organization of brain networks is affected by the different parcellation strategies applied.},

Compared with pattern classification studies, pattern regression considers the problem of estimating continuous rather than categorical variables, and can be more challenging. It is also clinically important, since it can be used to estimate disease stage and predict clinical progression from images. In this work, adaptive regional feature extraction approach is used along with other common feature extraction methods, and feature selection technique is adopted to produce a small number of discriminative features for optimal regression performance. Then the Relevance Vector Machine ({RVM)} is used to build regression models based on selected features. To get stable regression models from limited training samples, a bagging framework is adopted to build ensemble basis regressors derived from multiple bootstrap training samples, and thus to alleviate the effects of outliers as well as facilitate the optimal model parameter selection. Finally, this regression scheme is tested on simulated data and real data via cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that this regression scheme achieves higher estimation accuracy and better generalizing ability than Support Vector Regression ({SVR).}},

Functional connectivity is defined as the temporal dependency of neuronal activation patterns of anatomically separated brain regions and in the past years an increasing body of neuroimaging studies has started to explore functional connectivity by measuring the level of co-activation of resting-state {fMRI} time-series between brain regions. These studies have revealed interesting new findings about the functional connections of specific brain regions and local networks, as well as important new insights in the overall organization of functional communication in the brain network. Here we present an overview of these new methods and discuss how they have led to new insights in core aspects of the human brain, providing an overview of these novel imaging techniques and their implication to neuroscience. We discuss the use of spontaneous resting-state {fMRI} in determining functional connectivity, discuss suggested origins of these signals, how functional connections tend to be related to structural connections in the brain network and how functional brain communication may form a key role in cognitive performance. Furthermore, we will discuss the upcoming field of examining functional connectivity patterns using graph theory, focusing on the overall organization of the functional brain network. Specifically, we will discuss the value of these new functional connectivity tools in examining believed connectivity diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis.},

Networks of interconnected brain regions coordinate brain activities. Information is processed in the grey matter (cortex and subcortical structures) and passed along the network via whitish, fatty-coated fiber bundles, the white matter. Using maps of these white matter tracks, we provided evidence that higher intelligence may result from more efficient information transfer. Specifically, we hypothesized that higher {IQ} derives from higher global efficiency of the brain anatomical network. Seventy-nine healthy young adults were divided into general and high {IQ} groups. We used diffusion tensor tractography, which maps brain white matter fibers, to construct anatomical brain networks for each subject and calculated the network properties using both binary and weighted networks. We consistently found that the high intelligence group's brain network was significantly more efficient than was the general intelligence group's. Moreover, {IQ} scores were significantly correlated with network properties, such as shorter path lengths and higher overall efficiency, indicating that the information transfer in the brain was more efficient. These converging evidences support the hypothesis that the efficiency of the organization of the brain structure may be an important biological basis for intelligence.},

	abstract = {Classical accounts of the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease have emphasized degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons with consequent dysfunction of cortico-striatal-thalamic loops. In contrast, post-mortem studies indicate that pathological changes in Parkinson's disease (Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies) first appear primarily in the lower brainstem with subsequent progression to more rostral parts of the neuraxis. The nigrostriatal and histological perspectives are not incompatible, but they do emphasize different anatomical structures. To address the question of which brain structures are functionally most affected by Parkinson's disease, we performed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study focused on striatal functional connectivity. We contrasted 13 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease versus 19 age-matched control subjects, using methodology incorporating scrupulous attention to minimizing the effects of head motion during scanning. The principal finding in the Parkinson's disease group was markedly lower striatal correlations with thalamus, midbrain, pons and cerebellum. This result reinforces the importance of the brainstem in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. Focally altered functional connectivity also was observed in sensori-motor and visual areas of the cerebral cortex, as well the supramarginal gyrus. Striatal functional connectivity with the brainstem was graded (posterior putamen {\textgreater} anterior putamen {\textgreater} caudate), in both patients with Parkinson's disease and control subjects, in a manner that corresponds to well-documented gradient of striatal dopaminergic function loss in Parkinson's disease. We hypothesize that this gradient provides a clue to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.},

The aim of this study was to test if functional {MRI} âresting-stateâ connectivity patterns in auditory network differ between tinnitus patients and normal controls. Thirteen chronic tinnitus subjects and fifteen age-matched healthy controls were studied on a 3 tesla {MRI.} Connectivity was investigated using independent component analysis and an automated component selection approach taking into account the spatial and temporal properties of each component. Connectivity in extra-auditory regions such as brainstem, basal {ganglia/NAc}, cerebellum, parahippocampal, right prefrontal, parietal, and sensorimotor areas was found to be increased in tinnitus subjects. The right primary auditory cortex, left prefrontal, left fusiform gyrus, and bilateral occipital regions showed a decreased connectivity in tinnitus. These results show that there is a modification of cortical and subcortical functional connectivity in tinnitus encompassing attentional, mnemonic, and emotional networks. Our data corroborate the hypothesized implication of non-auditory regions in tinnitus physiopathology and suggest that various regions of the brain seem involved in the persistent awareness of the phenomenon as well as in the development of the associated distress leading to disabling chronic tinnitus.},

	abstract = {In brains of higher vertebrates, the functional segregation of local areas that differ in their anatomy and physiology contrasts sharply with their global integration during perception and behavior. In this paper, we introduce a measure, called neural complexity ({CN)}, that captures the interplay between these two fundamental aspects of brain organization. We express functional segregation within a neural system in terms of the relative statistical independence of small subsets of the system and functional integration in terms of significant deviations from independence of large subsets. {CN} is then obtained from estimates of the average deviation from statistical independence for subsets of increasing size. {CN} is shown to be high when functional segregation coexists with integration and to be low when the components of a system are either completely independent (segregated) or completely dependent (integrated). We apply this complexity measure in computer simulations of cortical areas to examine how some basic principles of neuroanatomical organization constrain brain dynamics. We show that the connectivity patterns of the cerebral cortex, such as a high density of connections, strong local connectivity organizing cells into neuronal groups, patchiness in the connectivity among neuronal groups, and prevalent reciprocal connections, are associated with high values of {CN.} The approach outlined here may prove useful in analyzing complexity in other biological domains such as gene regulation and embryogenesis.},

Neurons with similar morphologies and connectivities have been grouped together into classes; there are 118 such classes. Neurons have simple morphologies with few, if any, branches. Processes from neurons run in defined positions within bundles of parallel processes, synaptic connections being made en passant. Process bundles are arranged longitudinally and circumferentially and are often adjacent to ridges of hypodermis. Neurons are generally highly locally connected, making synaptic connections with many of their neighbours. Muscle cells have arms that run out to process bundles containing motoneuron axons. Here they receive their synaptic input in defined regions along the surface of the bundles, where motoneuron axons reside. Most of the morphologically identifiable synaptic connections in a typical animal are described. These consist of about 5000 chemical synapses, 2000 neuromuscular junctions and 600 gap junctions.},

One of the most important scientific challenges today is the quantitative and predictive understanding of biological function. Classical mathematical and computational approaches have been enormously successful in modeling inert matter, but they may be inadequate to address inherent features of biological systems. We address the conceptual and methodological obstacles that lie in the inverse problem in biological systems modeling. We introduce a full Bayesian approach ({FBA)}, a theoretical framework to study biological function, in which probability distributions are conditional on biophysical information that physically resides in the biological system that is studied by the scientist.},

Large-amplitude clear rhythmical slow activity ({RSA)} was recorded from the hippocampus proper and smaller amplitude {RSA} and fast activity was recorded from the dentate gyrus-{CA} 4 area. This was also observed in acute rat preparations. During large movements (run, jump) {RSA} amplitude was up to 6 times greater than during small movements (head turn, lever press). Initiation of movement was associated with an increase in {RSA} frequency, which was most pronounced with forceful movements. During steady running or swimming in the rat frequencies of 7â9 Hz were recorded and during prolonged running up to 8 hr {RSA} was unchanged. {RSA} frequency did not vary with the speed of steady running or steady locomotor patterns of swimming, walking, trotting or galloping. {RSA} frequency and amplitude may reflect different mechanisms; frequency was normal after hippocampal electrographic seizures, amplitude was depressed; frequency varied directly with core temperature (27â42Â° C) but amplitude remained constant. Increases in {RSA} frequency and amplitude during paradoxical sleep were associated with muscular twitches, suggesting that forebrain motor mechanisms were activated. The results are interpreted in support of the idea that {RSA} is related to higher level control of voluntary movement.},

We then demonstrate how to introduce control into these models. The addition of control shows how attractor networks can be used as subsystems in larger neural systems, demonstrates how a much larger class of networks can be related to attractor networks, and makes it clear how attractor networks can be exploited for various information processing tasks in neurobiological systems.},

Here we describe the generation and analysis of a transcriptional atlas of the adult human brain, comprising extensive histological analysis and comprehensive microarray profiling of {\textasciitilde}900 neuroanatomically precise subdivisions in two individuals. Transcriptional regulation varies enormously by anatomical location, with different regions and their constituent cell types displaying robust molecular signatures that are highly conserved between individuals. Analysis of differential gene expression and gene co-expression relationships demonstrates that brain-wide variation strongly reflects the distributions of major cell classes such as neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Local neighbourhood relationships between fine anatomical subdivisions are associated with discrete neuronal subtypes and genes involved with synaptic transmission. The neocortex displays a relatively homogeneous transcriptional pattern, but with distinct features associated selectively with primary sensorimotor cortices and with enriched frontal lobe expression. Notably, the spatial topography of the neocortex is strongly reflected in its molecular topographyâthe closer two cortical regions, the more similar their transcriptomes. This freely accessible online data resource forms a high-resolution transcriptional baseline for neurogenetic studies of normal and abnormal human brain function.},

Skolem's Paradox arises when we notice that the basicprinciples of Cantorian set theoryâi.e., the very principles usedto prove Cantor's theorem on the existence of uncountablesetsâcan themselves be formulated as a collection of first-ordersentences. How can the very principles which prove the existence ofuncountable sets be satisfied by a model which is itself onlycountable?

According to the dominant model of hippocampal cell assembly activity, place cell firing order is established for the first time during exploration, to encode the spatial experience, and is subsequently replayed during rest or slow-wave sleep for consolidation of the encoded experience. Here we report that temporal sequences of firing of place cells expressed during a novel spatial experience occurred on a significant number of occasions during the resting or sleeping period preceding the experience. This phenomenon, which is called preplay, occurred in disjunction with sequences of replay of a familiar experience. These results suggest that internal neuronal dynamics during resting or sleep organize hippocampal cellular assemblies into temporal sequences that contribute to the encoding of a related novel experience occurring in the future.},

	abstract = {The first part of this two-part paper presents a general theory of dissipative dynamical systems. The mathematical model used is a state space model and dissipativeness is defined in terms of an inequality involving the storage function and the supply function. It is shown that the storage function satisfies an a priori inequality: it is bounded from below by the available storage and from above by the required supply. The available storage is the amount of internal storage which may be recovered from the system and the required supply is the amount of supply which has to be delivered to the system in order to transfer it from the state of minimum storage to a given state. These functions are themselves possible storage functions, i.e., they satisfy the dissipation inequality. Moreover, since the class of possible storage functions forms a convex set, there is thus a continuum of possible storage functions ranging from its lower bound, the available storage, to its upper bound, the required supply. The paper then considers interconnected systems. It is shown that dissipative systems which are interconnected via a neutral interconnection constraint define a new dissipative dynamical system and that the sum of the storage functions of the individual subsystems is a storage function for the interconnected system. The stability of dissipative systems is then investigated and it is shown that a point in the state space where the storage function attains a local minimum defines a stable equilibrium and that the storage function is a Lyapunov function for this equilibrium. These results are then applied to several examples. These concepts and results will be applied to linear dynamical systems with quadratic supply rates in the second part of this paper.},

The human brain can be studied as a hierarchy of complex networks on different temporal and spatial scales. On each scale, from gene, protein, synapse, neuron and microcircuit, to area, pathway and the whole brain, many advances have been made with the development of related techniques. Brain network studies on different temporal and spatial scales are booming. However, such studies have focused on single levels, and can only reflect limited aspects of how the brain is formed and how it works. Therefore, it is increasingly urgent to integrate a variety of techniques, methods and models, and to merge fragmented findings into a uniform research framework or platform. To this end, we have proposed the concept of the brainnetome and several related programs/projects have been launched in China. In this paper, we offer a brief review on the methodologies of the brainnetome, which include techniques on different scales, the brainnetome atlas, and methods of brain network analysis. We then take Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia as examples to show how the brainnetome can be studied in neurological and psychiatric disorders. We also review the studies of how risk genes for brain diseases affect the brain networks. Finally, we summarize the challenges for the brainnetome, and what actions and measures have been taken to address these challenges in China. It is envisioned that the brainnetome will open new avenues and some long-standing issues may be solved by combining the brainnetome with other âomesâ.},

Deactivation was found in the default mode network involving the anterior frontal, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex. {MCI} patients showed less deactivation than {HC}, but more than {AD.} The most pronounced differences between {MCI}, {HC}, and {AD} occurred in the very early phase of deactivation, reflecting the reactivity and adaptation of the network. The default mode network response in the anterior frontal cortex significantly distinguished {MCI} from both {HC} (in the medial frontal) and {AD} (in the anterior cingulate cortex). The response in the precuneus could only distinguish between patients and {HC}, not between {MCI} and {AD.} These findings may be consistent with the notion that {MCI} is a transitional state between healthy aging and dementia and with the proposed early changes in {MCI} in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. These findings suggest that altered activity in the default mode network may act as an early marker for {AD} pathology.},

	abstract = {Neurocomputational models of large-scale brain dynamics utilizing realistic connectivity matrices have advanced our understanding of the operational network principles in the brain. In particular, spontaneous or resting state activity has been studied on various scales of spatial and temporal organization including those that relate to physiological, encephalographic and hemodynamic data. In this article we focus on the brain from the perspective of a dynamic network and discuss the role of its network constituents in shaping brain dynamics. These constituents include the brain's structural connectivity, the population dynamics of its network nodes and the time delays involved in signal transmission. In addition, no discussion of brain dynamics would be complete without considering noise and stochastic effects. In fact, there is mounting evidence that the interaction between noise and dynamics plays an important functional role in shaping key brain processes. In particular, we discuss a unifying theoretical framework that explains how structured spatio-temporal resting state patterns emerge from noise driven explorations of unstable or stable oscillatory states. Embracing this perspective, we explore the consequences of network manipulations to understand some of the brain's dysfunctions, as well as network effects that offer new insights into routes towards therapy, recovery and brain repair. These collective insights will be at the core of a new computational environment, the Virtual Brain, which will allow flexible incorporation of empirical data constraining the brain models to integrate, unify and predict network responses to incipient pathological processes.},

Greater extent of activation within the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal gyrus ({PHG)} was correlated with better memory performance. There was, however, a paradoxical relationship between extent of activation and clinical status at both baseline and follow-up evaluations. Subjects with greater clinical impairment, based on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, recruited a larger extent of the right {PHG} during encoding, even after accounting for atrophy. Moreover, those who subsequently declined over the 2.5 years of clinical follow-up (44\% of the subjects) activated a significantly greater extent of the right {PHG} during encoding, despite equivalent memory performance.

Wearing-off symptoms were observed in 66.7\% of {PD} patients (neurologists' assessment) and in 90.6\% of {PD} patients ({WOQ-9} questionnaire). The biggest discrepancy was found in {PD} patients treated with L-{DOPA} for 0-2ï¿½ years. The probability of detecting wearing-off by the neurologists strongly correlated with the highest number of positive responses in the {WOQ-9} marked by {PD} patients. There was significant difference in the diagnosis of wearing-off between Level A centers (77.7\%) and Level B centers (62.0\%). When motor and non-motor symptoms in the {WOQ-9} were considered, the difference between neurologists came from the detection of non-motor symptoms (lower in the Level B centers). The neurologists' assessment of wearing-off symptoms and {PD} patients' subjective evaluation of the {WOQ-9} is based on the experience of the neurologist and on the detection of the non-motor symptoms of wearing-off. Careful explanation of the {WOQ-9} questionnaire and improved awareness of the non-motor symptoms of wearing-off is strongly suggested.},

	abstract = {Numerous recent findings indicate the involvement of a neuroinflammatory reaction in the neurodegeneration in idiopathic Parkinson's disease ({PD).} We examined 29 consecutive patients with {PD}, ages 54-84 years, most of whom were moderately impaired (median {UPDRS} 19; Hoehn-Yahr 3; {MMSE} 28). A series of serum biomarkers were investigated, and their levels were correlated with the degree of the motor and cognitive impairment. There were no abnormalities of {IL-6}, acute phase proteins (C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, alpha 1-antitrypsin, orosomucoid, ceruloplasmin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, transferrin, prealbumin) and factors of the complement system (C1q, C1-{INH}, C3, C4). A decrease in Mannan-binding lectin ({MBL)} levels was observed in six patients; an elevation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ({TNF-alpha)} was found in 12 patients. No statistically significant correlation was found between the patient's clinical state (neuropsychologic and motor, as expressed by {UPDRS} {III}, Hoehn-Yahr, and {MMSE)} and the immunomarker changes. Our results indicate that the inflammatory process may be reflected in the serum; nevertheless, further research is needed to elucidate the possible clinical implications.},

	abstract = {Dejï¿½  vu ({DV)} is a widespread, fascinating and mysterious human experience. It occurs both in health and in disease, notably as an aura of temporal lobe epilepsy. This feeling of inappropriate familiarity has attracted interest from psychologists and neuroscientists for over a century, but still there is no widely agreed explanation for the phenomenon of non-pathological {DV.} Here we investigated differences in brain morphology between healthy subjects with and without {DV} using a novel multivariate neuroimaging technique, Source-Based Morphometry. The analysis revealed a set of cortical (predominantly mesiotemporal) and subcortical regions in which there was significantly less gray matter in subjects reporting {DV.} In these regions gray matter volume was inversely correlated with the frequency of {DV.} Our results demonstrate a structural correlate of {DV} in healthy individuals for the first time and support a neurological explanation for the phenomenon. We hypothesis that the observed local gray matter decrease in subjects experiencing {DV} reflects an alteration of hippocampal function and postnatal neurogenesis with resulting changes of volume in remote brain regions.},

Current practice in cognitive psychology is to accept a single model on the basis of only the "raw" {AIC} values, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret the observed {AIC} differences in terms of a continuous measure such as probability. Here we demonstrate that {AIC} values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham \& Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model. We show by example how these Akaike weights can greatly facilitate the interpretation of the results of {AIC} model comparison procedures.},

	abstract = {In 1906 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was shared between Camillo Golgi and RamÃ³n y Cajal in recognition of their work on the structure of the nervous system. Golgi's most impressive contribution was his method, described in 1873. This was applied in studies of the cerebellum, the olfactory bulb, hippocampus and the spinal cord. These studies together with his earlier work were included in his Opera Omnia, published in 1903. His method was highly praised by Cajal. His adherence to the reticular theory was opposed by Cajal, however, who had spelled out the neuron theory already in the late 1800s. Cajal's extraordinary contributions to the structure of the nervous system, based largely on the Golgi method and Ehrlich's methylene blue stain, were published in his Textura del Sistema Nerviosa de Hombre y de los Vertebrados, three volumes published from 1897 to 1904. Documents from the Nobel Archives reveal that KÃ¶lliker, Retzius and FÃ¼rst were the ones who proposed Golgi and Cajal for a shared prize. Golgi was nominated by Hertwig, as well. Cajal was proposed by Ziehen and Holmgren, and also by Retzius, as an alternative to a shared prize. Holmgren, who was commissioned to write the report to the Nobel Committee, found Cajal far superior to Golgi. Sundberg, asked for another evaluation, was more positive to Golgi's contributions than Holmgren. Gadelius supported Holmgren's views. The final vote gave a majority for a shared prize. The prize ceremony and the lectures were described in detail in Cajal's autobiography.},

He proclaimed that {âEpilepsy} is the name for occasional, sudden, excessive, rapid, and local discharge of grey matter.â He eliminated any need for a direct appeal to metaphysical agents by asserting that the nervous system is an exclusively sensorimotor machine constrained by the newly discovered conservation laws. In constructing his neurophysiology he accepted the phrenological assumption that the nervous system is composed of a number of physiologically discrete organs, each with a single function accessible to the diagnostician. By observing the march of epileptic seizures he developed the idea of somatotopic representation. He claimed that the nervous system is an evolutionary hierarchy of three levels connected by the process of weighted ordinal representation. His assertion of the Doctrine of Concomitance further separated the concerns, and the institutions, of the neurophysiologist from that of the psychiatrist. He came to reject the idea of the unconscious because he could not observe unequivocally unconscious behaviour at the bedside. Each of these ideas emerged from contemporaneous scientific streams, but Hughlings Jackson was the one to incorporate them into practical medicine. These neurological ideas gave physicians the methods, tools, principles and structures with which to establish a new science of clinical neurology.},

Some of the most fundamental concepts about the organization of somatosensory pathways are currently undergoing rapid and radical change. Maps represent some of these concepts pictorially, expressing the relationships between functions and structures. In these efforts to understand and to communicate ideas to others, we often create the âsemantic disturbanceâ noted by Van Vogt. In the interest of clarifying the relationship between a map and the concept it designates, the following pages explore the history of mapmaking in somatosensory cortex and summarize the evolution of the underlying ideas. Following this we examine more carefully how a map is made and what its limitations are.},

Such progress is essential since the observable properties of organisms - the phenotypes - are produced by the genotype in juxtaposition with the environment. Whereas much has been done to make {mRNA} and protein profiling possible, considerably less effort has been put into profiling the end products of gene expression, metabolites. To date, analytical approaches have been aimed primarily at the accurate quantification of a number of pre-defined target metabolites, or at producing fingerprints of metabolic changes without individually determining metabolite identities. Neither of these approaches allows the formation of an in-depth understanding of the biochemical behaviour within metabolic networks. Yet, by carefully choosing protocols for sample preparation and analytical techniques, a number of chemically different classes of compounds can be quantified simultaneously to enable such understanding. In this review, the terms describing various metabolite-oriented approaches are given, and the differences among these approaches are outlined. Metabolite target analysis, metabolite profiling, metabolomics, and metabolic fingerprinting are considered. For each approach, a number of examples are given, and potential applications are discussed.},

Furthermore, modularity plays a crucial role when trying to characterize distributed brain responses in terms of functional integration or coupling among brain areas. We consider additive factors logic and how it helped to shape the design and interpretation of studies at the inception of brain mapping, with a special focus on factorial designs. We look at factorial designs in activation experiments and in the context of lesionâdeficit mapping. In both cases, the presence or absence of interactions among various experimental factors has proven essential in understanding the context-sensitive nature of distributed but modular processing and discerning the nature of (potentially degenerate) structureâfunction relationships in cognitive neuroscience.},

Here we consider the possibility that this combination of sensitivity and range of response depends on the clustering of chemotactic receptors on the surface of the bacterium. We examine what will happen if ligand binding changes the activity of a receptor, propagating this change in activity to neighbouring receptors in a cluster. Calculations based on these assumptions show that sensitivity to extracellular ligands increases with the extent of spread of activity through an array of receptors, but that the range of concentrations over which the array works is severely diminished. However, a combination of low threshold of response and wide dynamic range can be attained if the cell has both clusters and single receptors on its surface, particularly if the extent of activity spread can adapt to external conditions. A mechanism of this kind can account quantitatively for the sensitivity and response range of E. coli to aspartate.},

I consider a putative mechanism for the formation of global neurocognitive state from interactions among interconnected cortical areas. In this model, each area makes a local assessment of its own current state, representing a partial assessment of organismic state, through the generation of packets of high-frequency oscillatory wave activity. The spatial amplitude modulation ({AM)} pattern of the wave packet is proposed to represent the expression of an areaâs current state in relation to the other areas with which it is interacting. Through their interactions, sets of cortical areas mutually constrain the {AM} patterns of their wave packets. It is proposed that this process leads to the manifestation of wave packets having cognitively consistent patterns, and the formation of globally unified consensual neurocognitive states.},

Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available. It is concluded that statistical mechanics need not be regarded as a physical theory dependent for its validity on the truth of additional assumptions not contained in the laws of mechanics (such as ergodicity, metric transitivity, equal a priori probabilities, etc.). Furthermore, it is possible to maintain a sharp distinction between its physical and statistical aspects. The former consists only of the correct enumeration of the states of a system and their properties; the latter is a straightforward example of statistical inference.},

A principle of "statistical complementarity" is pointed out, according to which the empirically verifiable probabilities of statistical mechanics necessarily correspond to incomplete predictions. A preliminary discussion is given of the second law of thermodynamics and of a certain class of irreversible processes, in an approximation equivalent to that of the semiclassical theory of radiation. It is shown that a density matrix does not in general contain all the information about a system that is relevant for predicting its behavior. In the case of a system perturbed by random fluctuating fields, the density matrix cannot satisfy any differential equation because ÏË(t) does not depend only on Ï(t), but also on past conditions The rigorous theory involves stochastic equations in the type Ï({t)=G(t}, 0)Ï(0), where the operator G is a functional of conditions during the entire interval (0--{\textgreater}t). Therefore a general theory of irreversible processes cannot be based on differential rate equations corresponding to time-proportional transition probabilities.

Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.},

A traditional, accepted perspective on epileptiform activity holds that hypersynchrony covering large brain regions is a hallmark of generalized seizures. However, a few recent reports have described substantial fluctuations in synchrony before and during ictal events, thus raising questions as to the widespread synchronization notion. In this study, we used magnetoencephalographic recordings from epileptic patients with generalized seizures and normal control subjects to address the extent of the phase synchronization (phase locking) in local (neighboring) and distant cortical areas and to explore the ongoing temporal dynamics for particular ranges of frequencies at which synchrony occurs, during interictal and ictal activity. Synchronization patterns were found to differ somewhat depending on the epileptic syndrome, with primary generalized absence seizures displaying more long-range synchrony in all frequency bands studied (3-55 Hz) than generalized tonic motor seizures of secondary (symptomatic) generalized epilepsy or frontal lobe epilepsy. However, all seizures were characterized by enhanced local synchrony compared with distant synchrony. There were fluctuations in the synchrony between specific cortical areas that varied from seizure to seizure in the same patient, but in most of the seizures studied, regardless of semiology, there was a constant pattern in the dynamics of synchronization, indicating that seizures proceed by a recruitment of neighboring neuronal networks. Together, these data indicate that the concept of widespread "hypersynchronous" activity during generalized seizures may be misleading and valid only for very specific neuronal ensembles and circumstances.},

We propose that human cortical activity coordinates sensory information with a motor plan to guide wayfinding behavior to known goal locations. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed invasive recordings from epileptic patients while they performed a spatially immersive, virtual taxi driver task. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found oscillations during both exploratory search and goal-seeking behavior and, in particular, during virtual movement, when sensory information and motor planning were both in flux, compared with periods of self-initiated stillness. oscillations had different topographic and spectral characteristics during searching than during goal-seeking, suggesting that different cortical networks exhibit depending on which cognitive functions are driving behavior (spatial learning during exploration vs orienting to a learned representation during goal-seeking). In contrast, oscillations in the beta band appeared to be related to simple motor planning, likely a variant of the Rolandic mu rhythm. These findings suggest that human cortical oscillations act to coordinate sensory and motor brain activity in various brain regions to facilitate exploratory learning and navigational planning.},

In regions exhibiting high levels of connexin43 expression, tens of astrocytes are labeled following single-cell intracellular injection. Importantly, both the expression and the permeability of gap junctions are tightly regulated. Such long- and short-term regulations indicate that astrocytic networks might be subject to remodeling and to some plasticity. Since evidence for neuro-glial interaction exists, the degree of coupling between astrocytes could participate to set the tone of neuronal activity and to determine the sphere of influenced neurons.

The design is based on the fact that the method of averaging produces equations that are capable only of locking or drift, not pathological complexity. Furthermore, it is shown that oscillators that interact by means of multiple pulses per cycle, dispersed around the cycle, behave like averaged equations, even if the number of pulses is small. We discuss the biological intuition behind this scheme, and show numerically that it works when the oscillators are taken to be composites, each unit of which is governed by a well-known model of a neural oscillator. Finally, we describe numerical methods for computing from equations for coupled limit cycle oscillators the averaged coupling functions of our theory.},

A novel model employs the properties of thermodynamic systems operating far from equilibrium, which is analyzed by linearization near adaptive operating points using root locus techniques. Such systems construct order by dissipating energy. Reinforcement learning of conditioned stimuli creates a landscape of attractors and their basins in each sensory cortex by forming nerve cell assemblies in cortical connectivity. Retrieval of a selected category of stored knowledge is by a phase transition that is induced by a conditioned stimulus, and that leads to pattern self-organization. Near self-regulated criticality the cortical background activity displays aperiodic null spikes at which analytic amplitude nears zero, and which constitute a form of Rayleigh noise. Phase transitions in recognition and recall are initiated at null spikes in the presence of an input signal, owing to the high signal-to-noise ratio that facilitates capture of cortex by an attractor, even by very weak activity that is typically evoked by a conditioned stimulus.},

To determine how tightly neuronal properties and synaptic strengths need to be tuned to produce a given network output, we simulated more than 20 million versions of a three-cell model of the pyloric network of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion using different combinations of synapse strengths and neuron properties. We found that virtually indistinguishable network activity can arise from widely disparate sets of underlying mechanisms, suggesting that there could be considerable animal-to-animal variability in many of the parameters that control network activity, and that many different combinations of synaptic strengths and intrinsic membrane properties can be consistent with appropriate network performance.},

The system possesses optimal performance when both kinds of noise are tuned to specific values, this corresponds to the Stochastic Resonance phenomenon.

Coupled oscillator systems are considered to represent the {Wilson/Cowan/Ermentrout/Cowan-model} aspect of the unifying theory. Building on a model proposed by Haken, Kelso, and Bunz and the theory of weakly coupled oscillators established by Winfree and by Kuramoto, we derive a nonlinear {FokkerâPlanck} equation whose stationary solutions mimic the neocortical brain activity observed in our experiments.},

The transition routes showed individual tendencies, not necessarily in agreement with predictions derived from the sine circle map. Therefore, a more detailed theoretical model of coupled oscillators was developed. In the model the interaction function is a polynomial of coupling terms which allow for specific frequency locks. The magnitudes of these coupling terms are related to the amplitude of oscillation and the order of the frequency lock. Because increase in movement frequency is associated with a drop in amplitude, it results in differential loss of stability of the allowed frequency ratios. New frequency-locked states may be attained by detuning the stiffness parameters of the component oscillators. The model accounts for both free-running solutions and individual tendencies in transition routes. The relative weights of the coupling terms are influenced by practice and intention.},

	abstract = {The brain can be regarded as an ensemble of connected dynamical systems and as such conforms to some simple principles relating the inputs and outputs of its constituent parts. The ensuing implications, for the way we think about, and measure, neuronal interactions, can be quite profound. These range from 1) implications for which aspects of neuronal activity are important to measure and how to characterize coupling among neuronal populations; 2) implication for understanding the emergence of dynamic receptive fields and functionally specialized brain architectures; and 3) teleological implications pertaining to the genesis of dynamic instability and complexity, which is necessary for adaptive self-organization. This review focuses on the first set of implications by looking at neuronal interactions, coupling, and implicit neuronal codes from a dynamical perspective. By considering the brain in this light, one can show that a sufficient description of neuronal activity must comprise activity at the current time and its recent history. This history constitutes a neuronal transient. Such transients represent an essential metric of neuronal interactions and, implicitly, a code employed in the functional integration of brain systems. The nature of transients, expressed conjointly in different neuronal populations, reflects the underlying coupling among brain systems. A complete description of this coupling, or effective connectivity, can be expressed in terms of generalized convolution kernels (Volterra kernels) that embody high-order or nonlinear interactions. This coupling may be synchronous, and possibly oscillatory, or asynchronous. A critical distinction between synchronous and asynchronous coupling is that the former is essentially linear and the latter is nonlinear. The nonlinear nature of asynchronous coupling enables the rich, context-sensitive interactions that characterize real brain dynamics, suggesting that it plays an important role in functional integration.},

	abstract = {The discussion as to whether societies are organisms andvice versa has been going on for a long time. The question is meaningless unless a clear definition of the term âorganismâ is made. Once such a definition is made, the question may be answered by studying whether there exists any relational isomorphism between what the biologist calls an organism and what the sociologist calls society. Such a study should also include animal societies studied by ecologists. Both human and animal societies are sets of individuals together with certain other objects which are the products of their activities. A multicellular organism is a set of cells together with some products of their activities. A cell itself may be regarded as a set of genes together with the products of their activities because every component of the cell is either directly or indirectly the result of the activities of the genes. Thus it is natural to define both biological and social organisms as special kinds of sets. A number of definitions are given in this paper which define what we call here organismic sets. Postulates are introduced which characterize such sets, and a number of conclusions are drawn. It is shown that an organismic set, as defined here, does represent some basic relational aspects of both biological organisms and societies. In particular a clarification and a sharpening of the Postulate of Relational Forces given previously (Bull. Math. Biophysics,28, 283â308, 1966) is presented. It is shown that from the basic definitions and postulates of the theory of organismic sets, it folows that only such elements of those sets will aggregate spontaneously, which are not completely âspecializedâ in the performance of only one activity. It is further shown that such ânon-specializedâ elements undergo a process of specialization, and as a result of it their spontaneous aggregation into organismic sets becomes impossible. This throws light on the problem of the origin of life on Earth and the present absence of the appearance of life by spontaneous generation. Some applications to problems of ontogenesis and philogenesis are made. Finally the relation between physics, biology, and sociology is discussed in the light of the theory of organismic sets.},

To conform better with some biological and sociological facts the basic definitions are made more general. The conclusion is reached that every organismic {setS} o is in general the union of three disjoined {subsetsS} o1 {,S} o2 {andS} o3 . Of these the {subsetS} o1 , called the âcoreâ is equivalent to an organismic set defined in previous publications. Its functioning is essential for the functioning {ofS} o . The {subsetsS} o2 {andS} o3 , taken alone, are not organismic sets. The first of them is responsible for such biological or sociological functions which are not necessary for the âimmediateâ survival {ofS} o but which are important for adaptation to changing environment and are therefore essential for a âlong range survival.â The second {one,S} o3 , is responsible for biological or social functions which are irrelevant for the survival {ofS} o . Biological and sociological examples {ofS} o2 {andS} o3 are given. In addition to the fundamental theorem established in the first of the above mentioned papers, three new conclusions are derived. One is that in organismic sets of order higher than zero not all elements are specialized. The second is that every organismic set of order higher than zero is mortal. The third is that with increasing specialization the intensities of some activities in some elements {ofS} o are reduced. Again the biological and sociological examples are given. At the end some very general speculations are made on the possible relation between biology and physics and on the possibility of ârelationalizingâ physics.},

	url = {http://www.bri.ucla.edu/nha/ishn/ab27-2007.htm},
	abstract = {The roots of the concept of cortical columns stretch far back into the history of neuroscience. The impulse to compartmentalise the cortex into functional units can be seen at work in the phrenology of the beginning of the nineteenth century. At the beginning of the next century Korbinian Brodmann and several others published treatises on cortical architectonics. Later, in the middle of that century, Lorente de No writes of chains of âreverberatoryâ neurons orthogonal to the pial surface of the cortex and called them âelementary units of cortical activityâ. This is the first hint that a columnar organisation might exist. With the advent of microelectrode recording first Vernon Mountcastle (1957) and then David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel provided evidence consistent with the idea that columns might constitute units of physiological activity. This idea was backed up in the 1970s by clever histochemical techniques and culminated in Hubel and Wieselâs well-known âice-cubeâ model of the cortex and Szentogathaiâs brilliant iconography. The cortical column can thus be seen as the terminus ad quem of several great lines of neuroscientific research: currents originating in phrenology and passing through cytoarchitectonics; currents originating in neurocytology and passing through Lorente de No. Famously, Huxley noted the tragedy of a beautiful hypothesis destroyed by an ugly fact. Famously, too, human visual perception is orientated toward seeing edges and demarcations when, perhaps, they are not there. Recently the concept of cortical columns has come in for the same radical criticism that undermined the architectonics of the early part of the twentieth century. Does history repeat itself? This paper reviews this history and asks the question.},

As an application, we analyse a new and unique dataset on the {USD} 1.2 trillion {FED} emergency loans program to global financial institutions during 2008-2010. We find that a group of 22 institutions, which received most of the funds, form a strongly connected graph where each of the nodes becomes systemically important at the peak of the crisis. Moreover, a systemic default could have been triggered even by small dispersed shocks. The results suggest that the debate on too-big-to-fail institutions should include the even more serious issue of too-central-to-fail.},

We analyze the global banking network using data on cross-border banking flows for 184 countries during 1978â2010. We find that the density of the global banking network defined by these flows is pro-cyclical, expanding and contracting with the global cycle of capital flows. We also find that country connectedness in the network tends to rise before banking and debt crises and to fall in their aftermath. Despite a historically unique build-up in aggregate flows prior to the global financial crisis, network density in 2007 was comparable to earlier peaks. This suggests that factors other than connectedness, such as the location of the initial shock to the core of the network, have contributed to the severity of the crisis. The global financial crisis stands out as an unusually large perturbation to the global banking network, with indicators of network density in 2008 reaching all-time lows.},

We model systemic risk with two main components: a random shock that weakens one or more financial institutions and a transmission mechanism which transmits and possibly exacerbates such negative effects to the rest of the system. Our model could be conceptually represented by a network already described in previous works. In this work we show how is possible to estimate the distribution of losses for the banking system with our model. Additionally, we show how it is possible to separate the distribution of losses into two components: the losses incurred by the initial shock and the losses resulting from the contagion process. Finally, once the distribution is estimated, we can derive standard risk measures for the system as a whole. Another important contribution of this work is that we can follow the evolution of certain risk measures like the expected loss or the {CVaR} in order to evaluate if the system is becoming more or less risky, in fact, more or less fragile. Additionally, we can decompose the distribution of losses of the whole banking system into the systemic and the contagion elements and we can determine if the system is more prone to experience contagious difficulties during a certain period of time.},

Experimental work demonstrates that individual identified neurons in different animals may show variations as large as 2-5 fold in the conductance densities of specific ion channels. Theoretical work shows that models with this range of variation in many of their maximal conductances can produce similar activity. Together, these observations suggest that neurons and networks may be less tightly tuned than previously thought. Consequently, we argue that instead of attempting to construct single canonical models of neuronal function, it might be more useful to construct and analyze large families of models that give similar behavior.},

In the first, genes have overlapping functions, and loss-of-function mutations in one gene will have little phenotypic effect if there are one or more additional genes with similar functions. The second mechanism has its origin in interactions between genes with unrelated functions, and has been documented in metabolic and regulatory gene networks. Here I analyse, on a genome-wide scale, which of these mechanisms of robustness against mutations is more prevalent. I used functional genomics data from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to test hypotheses related to the following: if gene duplications are mostly responsible for robustness, then a correlation is expected between the similarity of two duplicated genes and the effect of mutations in one of these genes. My results demonstrate that interactions among unrelated genes are the major cause of robustness against mutations. This type of robustness is probably an evolved response of genetic networks to stabilizing selection.},

	abstract = {Genetic mutations that lead to undetectable or minimal changes in phenotypes are said to reveal redundant functions. Redundancy is common among phenotypes of higher organisms that experience low mutation rates and small population sizes. Redundancy is less common among organisms with high mutation rates and large populations, or among the rapidly dividing cells of multicellular organisms. In these cases, one even observes the opposite tendency: a hypersensitivity to mutation, which we refer to as antiredundancy. In this paper we analyze the evolutionary dynamics of redundancy and antiredundancy. Assuming a cost of redundancy, we find that large populations will evolve antiredundant mechanisms for removing mutants and thereby bolster the robustness of wild-type genomes; whereas small populations will evolve redundancy to ensure that all individuals have a high chance of survival. We propose that antiredundancy is as important for developmental robustness as redundancy, and is an essential mechanism for ensuring tissue-level stability in complex multicellular organisms. We suggest that antiredundancy deserves greater attention in relation to cancer, mitochondrial disease, and virus infection.},

When recorded from behaving animals, by far the most obvious firing pattern of the primary neurons of the hippocampus is the place field: a cell tends to fire only when the animal's head is in a particular part of its environment. It seems reasonable to suspect that the primary firing correlate of the primary neurons of a structure should underlie the primary function of that structure as revealed by behavioral lesion experiments. However, we are currently still at a loss to explain how the firing of hippocampal neurons contributes to hippocampal function. This review seeks to examine the commonalities between place cells and episodic memory, and posits that an analogy can be made between the stabilization of place fields and the consolidation of memory.},

That this map is necessary for spatial memory formation is indicated by the propensity of almost all navigational tasks to be disrupted by hippocampal damage. The hippocampus has also long been implicated in the formation of episodic memories, and the unusually plastic nature of hippocampal synapses testifies to its probable mnemonic role. Arguably, the place cell representation should, if it is to support spatial learning, be modifiable according to known principles of synaptic reorganization. The present article reviews evidence that the place cell representation is indeed plastic, and that its plasticity depends on the same neurobiological mechanisms known to underlie experimentally induced synaptic plasticity. Inferences are drawn regarding the architecture of the spatial representation and the principles by which it is modified. Spatial learning is promising to be the first kind of memory which is completely understood at all levels, from molecular through circuitry to behaviour and beyond.},

The cognitive map theory posits a special role in mapping large-scale space, whereas the relational theory argues it supports amodal relational processing. Here, we pit the two theories against each other using a novel paradigm in which the relational processing involved in navigating in a city was matched with similar navigational and relational processing demands in a nonspatial (social) domain. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants determined the optimal route either between friends' homes or between the friends themselves using social connections. Separate brain networks were engaged preferentially during the two tasks, with hippocampal activation driven only by spatial relational processing. We conclude that the human hippocampus appears to have a bias toward the processing of spatial relationships, in accordance with the cognitive map theory. Our results both advance our understanding of the nature of the hippocampal contribution to memory and provide insights into how social networks are instantiated at the neural level.},

In order to assess further the physiological role of {MGluRs} in {LTP}, we injected freely moving rats with the recently available, competitive {mGluR} antagonist ({R,S)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine} ({MCPG)} intraventricularly and recorded extracellularly the population spike ({PS)} as well as the field excitatory postsynaptic potential ({fEPSP)} of the granule cells of the dentate gyrus in response to stimulation of fibers of the perforant path. {MCPG} was administered in two concentrations (A = 20 {mM/5} microliters; B = 200 {mM/5} microliters) either 30 min prior to or 5 min after {LTP} induction. Sodium chloride infusion served as a control. Normal synaptic transmission was not altered by {MCPG.} However, the {mGluR} antagonist inhibited {LTP} in a concentration-dependent manner. Concentration A did not influence the potentiation shortly after the tetanus. In the {PS}, short-term potentiation ({STP)}, which is decremental in its time course, occurred normally, but in contrast to controls the potentiation declined back to baseline values after 2â3 hr. This dose also reduced the posttetanic increase in the slope function of the {fEPSP}, and led to a time course of potentiation similar to that for the {PS.} Concentration B completely abolished the tetanus-induced potentiation. This block was similar to that obtained for the {NMDA} antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate ({AP5).} Both {MCPG} concentrations had no influence on the time course of preestablished {LTP.} These effects seem to be due to the action of the (+)-isomer of {MCPG}, since intracerebroventricular application of the (- )-isomer was without effect on the duration and magnitude of {LTP.} In addition, we were interested in the {mGluR} subtypes involved in the blocking mechanism of {MCPG.} {1S,3R-aminocyclopentane-1},3-dicarboxic acid ({ACPD)-activated} {PPI} hydrolysis in hippocampal slices was competitively inhibited by {MCPG} at a concentration of 1 {mM} or higher. In contrast, this concentration of {MCPG} did not affect the reduction of forskolin- stimulated {cAMP} formation by {ACPD.} These results corroborate recent findings that {mGluRs} are required for the induction of {LTP} in {CA1} and {CA3} in vitro (Bashir et al., 1993; Sergueeva et al., 1993) and in vivo (Riedel and Reymann, 1993). The process of {STP} is found to be independent of {mGluR} activation.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS)}},

	abstract = {The hippocampal formation has been extensively studied for its special role in visual spatial learning and navigation. To ascertain the nature of the associations made, or computations performed, by hippocampus, it is important to delineate the functional contributions of its afferents. Therefore, single units were recorded in the lateral dorsal nucleus of the thalamus ({LDN)} as rats performed multiple trials on a radial maze. Many {LDN} neurons selectively discharged when an animal's head was aligned along particular directions in space, irrespective of its location in the test room. These direction-sensitive cells were localized to the dorsal aspect of the caudal two-thirds of the {LDN}, the site of innervation by retinal recipient pretectal and intermediate/deep-layer superior colliculus cells (Thompson and Robertson, 1987b). The directional specificity and preference of {LDN} cells were disrupted if rats were placed on the maze in darkness. If the room light was then turned on, the original preference was restored. If the light was again turned off, directional firing was maintained briefly. Normal directional firing lasted about 2-3 min. After this time, the directional preference (but not specificity) appeared to "rotate" systematically in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. The duration of normal directional discharge patterns in darkness could be extended to 30 min by varying the behavior of the animal. {LDN} cells required visual input to initialize reliable directional firing. After the rat viewed the environment, directional specificity was maintained in the absence of visual cues. Maximal directional firing was achieved only when the rat viewed the entire test room, and not just the scene associated with the directional preference of the cell. Thus, contextual information seems important. Also, a significant correlation was found between directional specificity and errors made on the maze during acquisition of the task. It was concluded that the {LDN} may pass on to the hippocampal formation directional information that is not merely a reflection of current sensory input. As such, the {LDN} may serve an important integrative function for limbic spatial learning systems.},

	volume = {13},

	abstract = {To investigate the spatial and behavioral correlates of striatal neurons during displacement movements, the rostromedial dorsal striata ({AP} 1.0-2.2, {ML} 1.5-2.0) of five rats were surgically implanted with advanceable bundles of fine wire electrodes. After recovery, the rats were deprived of water and trained in a square-walled open field in a dark room. The behavioral task required alternating visits to water reservoirs in the center and in the four corners. A certain corner contained the first reward for each trial; after this reward, a cue card appeared in this corner for the rest of the trial. The firing rates of striatal units were compared as the rat moved between the center and the four corners of the arena. Analyses were made of 30 units. Eight of these had firing rates that significantly increased or decreased by 62-480\% while the rat was in one or more quadrants of the arena. Six of these manifested such firing rate changes only as the rat performed certain behavioral sequences in the quadrant. Three other units fired as the rat's head was in a certain orientation relative to the arena walls, in all parts of the arena. To determine the principal controlling cues and hence the frame of reference of spatial selectivity of these units, the arena, while the rat was still inside, was rotated in total darkness. The first water reward was then presented at the same position relative to the outside room as before the rotation. The cue card was then illuminated in this corner as a visual cue for the extra-arena reference frame. All 11 neurons demonstrated spatial selectivity that rotated with the arena; thus, this activity was in the frame of reference of the arena and was not controlled by the visual cue. Six other units fired at rates up to six times their resting discharge or stopped firing completely in synchrony with initiation or execution of displacement movements, and two of these were also location selective. Four other units were silent as the rat performed the task, but fired tonically following arena rotations or other interruptions of the session, independent of the rat's location or movements. Nine analyzed units had very low firing rates ({\textless} 1 impulse/sec) and showed no discernible changes in activity as the rat performed the task. These patterns of unit activity indicate that fundamental informational components required for navigation are coded in the striatum.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS)}},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis ({ICA)} is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of {ICA}, and our recent work on the subject.},

	abstract = {Cortical functional connectivity, as indicated by the concurrent spontaneous activity of spatially segregated regions, is being studied increasingly because it may determine the reaction of the brain to external stimuli and task requirements and it is reportedly altered in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. In functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)}, such functional connectivity is investigated commonly by correlating the time course of a chosen "seed voxel" with the remaining voxel time courses in a voxel-by-voxel manner. This approach is biased by the actual choice of the seed voxel, however, because it only shows functional connectivity for the chosen brain region while ignoring other potentially interesting patterns of coactivation. We used spatial independent component analysis ({sICA)} to assess cortical functional connectivity maps from resting state data. {SICA} does not depend on any chosen temporal profile of local brain activity. We hypothesized that {sICA} would be able to find functionally connected brain regions within sensory and motor regions in the absence of task-related brain activity. We also investigated functional connectivity patterns of several parietal regions including the superior parietal cortex and the posterior cingulate gyrus. The components of interest were selected in an automated fashion using predefined anatomical volumes of interest. {SICA} yielded connectivity maps of bilateral auditory, motor and visual cortices. Moreover, it showed that prefrontal and parietal areas are also functionally connected within and between hemispheres during the resting state. These connectivity maps showed an extremely high degree of consistency in spatial, temporal, and frequency parameters within and between subjects. These results are discussed in the context of the recent debate on the functional relevance of fluctuations of neural activity in the resting state.},

The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in "blind" signal processing.},

The purpose of this study was to measure the contributions of low frequencies and physiological noise to cross-correlation maps.
{METHODS:} In four healthy volunteers, task-activation functional {MR} imaging and resting-state data were acquired. We obtained four contiguous slice locations in the "resting state" with a high sampling rate. Regions of interest consisting of four contiguous voxels were selected. The correlation coefficient for the averaged time course and every other voxel in the four slices was calculated and separated into its component frequency contributions. We calculated the relative amounts of the spectrum that were in the low-frequency (0 to 0.1 Hz), the respiratory-frequency (0.1 to 0.5 Hz), and cardiac-frequency range (0.6 to 1.2 Hz).
{RESULTS:} For each volunteer, resting-state maps that resembled task-activation maps were obtained. For the auditory and visual cortices, the correlation coefficient depended almost exclusively on low frequencies ({\textless}0.1 Hz). For all cortical regions studied, low-frequency fluctuations contributed more than 90\% of the correlation coefficient. Physiological (respiratory and cardiac) noise sources contributed less than 10\% to any functional connectivity {MR} imaging map. In blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid, physiological noise contributed more to the correlation coefficient.
{CONCLUSION:} Functional connectivity in the auditory, visual, and sensorimotor cortices is characterized predominantly by frequencies slower than those in the cardiac and respiratory cycles. In functionally connected regions, these low frequencies are characterized by a high degree of temporal coherence.},

Areas activated in association with the control of eye movements included the superior parietal lobule and the frontal eye fields. The cooperation of different brain areas was analysed by correlating the time course of task-dependent {BOLD} signal changes in these areas. This correlation analysis revealed coactivation of occipitotemporal object recognition areas and a spatial transformation area in the intraparietal sulcus during the reading of transformed letter strings.

This review will focus mainly on recent findings concerning graph theoretical analysis of human brain networks with a variety of imaging modalities, including structural {MRI}, diffusion {MRI}, functional {MRI}, and {EEG/MEG.}
{RECENT} {FINDINGS:} Recent studies have utilized graph theoretical approaches to investigate the organizational principles of brain networks. These studies have consistently shown many important statistical properties underlying the topological organization of the human brain, including modularity, small-worldness, and the existence of highly connected network hubs. Importantly, these quantifiable network properties were found to change during normal development, aging, and various neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Moreover, several studies have also suggested that these network properties correlate with behavioral and genetic factors.
{SUMMARY:} The exciting research regarding graph theoretical analysis of brain connectivity yields truly integrative and comprehensive descriptions of the structural and functional organization of the human brain, which provides important implications for health and disease. Future research will most likely involve integrative models of brain structural and functional connectivity with multimodal neuroimaging data, exploring whether graph-based brain network analysis could yield reliable biomarkers for disease diagnosis and treatment.},

Concurrently, novel technologies have been developed for characterizing the connective anatomy of intra-regional circuits and inter-regional fiber pathways.

Here, we review the practicality and the value of these efforts, while at the same time considering in which cases and to what extent structure does determine neural function. Studies of the healthy brain, of neural development, and of pathology all yield examples of direct correspondences between structural linkage and dynamical correlation. Theoretical arguments further support the notion that brain network topology and spatial embedding should strongly influence network dynamics. Although future models will need to be tested more quantitatively and against a wider range of empirical neurodynamic features, our present large-scale models can already predict the macroscopic pattern of dynamic correlation across the brain. We conclude that as neuroscience grapples with datasets of increasing completeness and complexity, and attempts to relate the structural and functional architectures discovered at different neural scales, the value of computational modeling will continue to grow.},

The image that is perceptually dominant alternates every few seconds. We used this phenomenon to investigate neural correlates of conscious perception. We presented a red vertical grating to one eye and a blue horizontal grating to the other eye, with each grating continuously flickering at a distinct frequency (the frequency tag for that stimulus). Steady-state magnetic fields were recorded with a 148 sensor whole-head magnetometer while the subjects reported which grating was perceived. The power of the steady-state magnetic field at the frequency associated with a grating typically increased at multiple sensors when the grating was perceived. Changes in power related to perceptual dominance, presumably reflecting local neural synchronization, reached statistical significance at several sensors, including some positioned over occipital, temporal, and frontal cortices. To identify changes in synchronization between distinct brain areas that were related to perceptual dominance, we analyzed coherence between pairs of widely separated sensors. The results showed that when the stimulus was perceived there was a marked increase in both interhemispheric and intrahemispheric coherence at the stimulus frequency. This study demonstrates a direct correlation between the conscious perception of a visual stimulus and the synchronous activity of large populations of neocortical neurons as reflected by stimulus-evoked steady-state neuromagnetic fields.},

	abstract = {The segmentation of visual scenes is a fundamental process of early vision, but the underlying neural mechanisms are still largely unknown. Theoretical considerations as well as neurophysiological findings point to the importance in such processes of temporal correlations in neuronal activity. In a previous model, we showed that reentrant signaling among rhythmically active neuronal groups can correlate responses along spatially extended contours. We now have modified and extended this model to address the problems of perceptual grouping and figure-ground segregation in vision. A novel feature is that the efficacy of the connections is allowed to change on a fast time scale. This results in active reentrant connections that amplify the correlations among neuronal groups. The responses of the model are able to link the elements corresponding to a coherent figure and to segregate them from the background or from another figure in a way that is consistent with the so-called Gestalt laws.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

	abstract = {This article examines functional and anatomical connectivity in healthy human subjects measured with magnetic resonance imaging methods. Anatomical connectivity in white matter is obtained from measurements of the diffusion tensor. A Monte-Carlo simulation determines the probability that a particle diffuses between two points, with the probability of a jump in a particular direction from a given voxel being based on the local value of the diffusion tensor components. Functional connectivity between grey matter pixels is assessed without recourse to a specific activation paradigm, by calculating the correlation coefficient between random fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal time course in different pixels. The methods are used to examine the anatomical and functional connectivities between crowns of adjacent gyri. A high functional connectivity was found between grey matter pixels, with white matter displaying only very low correlation. A comparison of the measurements of anatomical and functional connectivity found that there is no simple correlation between these measures, except that low values of functional connectivity were not found together with high values of anatomical connectivity. Furthermore pairs of regions situated around the central sulcus indicated a dependence of the two connectivity measures on each other. These results are in accordance with an interpretation that regions which are clearly directly linked by white matter fiber tracts should show high functional connectivity, but that the inverse need not be true as functional connectivity may also be indirectly mediated via more distant grey matter regions.},

Here, we applied the discrete wavelet transform to functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} time series, acquired from healthy volunteers in the resting state, to estimate frequency-dependent correlation matrices characterizing functional connectivity between 90 cortical and subcortical regions. After thresholding the wavelet correlation matrices to create undirected graphs of brain functional networks, we found a small-world topology of sparse connections most salient in the low-frequency interval 0.03â0.06 Hz. Global mean path length (2.49) was approximately equivalent to a comparable random network, whereas clustering (0.53) was two times greater; similar parameters have been reported for the network of anatomical connections in the macaque cortex. The human functional network was dominated by a neocortical core of highly connected hubs and had an exponentially truncated power law degree distribution. Hubs included recently evolved regions of the heteromodal association cortex, with long-distance connections to other regions, and more cliquishly connected regions of the unimodal association and primary cortices; paralimbic and limbic regions were topologically more peripheral. The network was more resilient to targeted attack on its hubs than a comparable scale-free network, but about equally resilient to random error. We conclude that correlated, low-frequency oscillations in human {fMRI} data have a small-world architecture that probably reflects underlying anatomical connectivity of the cortex. Because the major hubs of this network are critical for cognition, its slow dynamics could provide a physiological substrate for segregated and distributed information processing.},

Images were parcellated using a prior anatomical template, yielding regional mean time series for each of 90 regions (major cortical gyri and subcortical nuclei) in each subject. Significant pairwise functional connections, defined by the group mean inter-regional partial correlation matrix, were mostly either local and intrahemispheric or symmetrically interhemispheric. Low-frequency components in the time series subtended stronger inter-regional correlations than high-frequency components. Intrahemispheric connectivity was generally related to anatomical distance by an inverse square law; many symmetrical interhemispheric connections were stronger than predicted by the anatomical distance between bilaterally homologous regions. Strong interhemispheric connectivity was notably absent in data acquired from a single patient, minimally conscious following a brainstem lesion. Multivariate analysis by hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling consistently defined six major systems in healthy volunteers â corresponding approximately to four neocortical lobes, medial temporal lobe and subcortical nuclei â that could be further decomposed into anatomically and functionally plausible subsystems, e.g. dorsal and ventral divisions of occipital cortex. An undirected graph derived by thresholding the healthy group mean partial correlation matrix demonstrated local clustering or cliquishness of connectivity and short mean path length compatible with prior data on small world characteristics of non-human cortical anatomy. Functional {MRI} demonstrates a neurophysiological architecture of the normal human brain that is anatomically sensible, strongly symmetrical, disrupted by acute brain injury, subtended predominantly by low frequencies and consistent with a small world network topology.},

Here we propose a method based on the conditional mutual information ({CMI)} in the frequency domain. {CMI} maps quantify the amount of non-redundant covariability between each site and all others in the rest of the brain, partialling out the joint variability due to gross physiological noise. Average maps from a sample of 45 healthy individuals scanned in the resting state show a clear and symmetric pattern of connectivity maxima in several regions of cortex, including prefrontal, orbitofrontal, lateralâparietal, and midline default mode network components; and in subcortical nuclei, including the amygdala, thalamus, and basal ganglia. Such cortical and subcortical hotspots of functional connectivity were more clearly evident at lower frequencies (0.02â0.1 Hz) than at higher frequencies (0.1â0.2 Hz) of endogenous oscillation. {CMI} mapping can also be easily applied to perform group analyses. This is exemplified by exploring effects of normal aging on {CMI} in a sample of healthy controls and by investigating correlations between {CMI} and positive psychotic symptom scores in a sample of 40 schizophrenic patients. Both the normative aging and schizophrenia studies reveal functional connectivity trends that converge with reported findings from other studies, thus giving further support to the validity of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to the identification of nonlinear input-state-output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to the dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the implicit causal model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters that mediate the influence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2) parameters that mediate intrinsic coupling among the states, and (3) [bilinear] parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that coupling. Identification proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known, deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the system. We developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity using experimentally designed inputs and {fMRI} responses. In this context, the coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity and the bilinear parameters reflect the changes in connectivity induced by inputs. The ensuing framework allows one to characterise {fMRI} experiments, conceptually, as an experimental manipulation of integration among brain regions (by contextual or trial-free inputs, like time or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked responses (to perturbations or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with previous analyses of effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally induced changes in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However, unlike previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes responses to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as unknown and stochastic.},

Recent studies suggest that it may also play a vital role in enabling the evolution of species. Increasing robustness, so is proposed, can lead to the emergence of evolvability if evolution proceeds over a neutral network that extends far throughout the fitness landscape. Here, we show that the design principles used to achieve robustness dramatically influence whether robustness leads to evolvability. In simulation experiments, we find that purely redundant systems have remarkably low evolvability while degenerate, i.e. partially redundant, systems tend to be orders of magnitude more evolvable. Surprisingly, the magnitude of observed variation in evolvability can neither be explained by differences in the size nor the topology of the neutral networks. This suggests that degeneracy, a ubiquitous characteristic in biological systems, may be an important enabler of natural evolution. More generally, our study provides valuable new clues about the origin of innovations in complex adaptive systems.},

	abstract = {Background Cognitive abilities, such as working memory, differ among people; however, individuals also vary in their own day-to-day cognitive performance. One potential source of cognitive variability may be fluctuations in the functional organization of neural systems. The degree to which the organization of these functional networks is optimized may relate to the effective cognitive functioning of the individual. Here we specifically examine how changes in the organization of large-scale networks measured via resting state functional connectivity {MRI} and graph theory track changes in working memory capacity. {Methodology/Principal} Findings Twenty-two participants performed a test of working memory capacity and then underwent resting-state {fMRI.} Seventeen subjects repeated the protocol three weeks later. We applied graph theoretic techniques to measure network organization on 34 brain regions of interest ({ROI).} Network modularity, which measures the level of integration and segregation across sub-networks, and small-worldness, which measures global network connection efficiency, both predicted individual differences in memory capacity; however, only modularity predicted intra-individual variation across the two sessions. Partial correlations controlling for the component of working memory that was stable across sessions revealed that modularity was almost entirely associated with the variability of working memory at each session. Analyses of specific sub-networks and individual circuits were unable to consistently account for working memory capacity variability. {Conclusions/Significance} The results suggest that the intrinsic functional organization of an a priori defined cognitive control network measured at rest provides substantial information about actual cognitive performance. The association of network modularity to the variability in an individual's working memory capacity suggests that the organization of this network into high connectivity within modules and sparse connections between modules may reflect effective signaling across brain regions, perhaps through the modulation of signal or the suppression of the propagation of noise.},

	abstract = {An important issue in neuroscience is the characterization for the underlying architectures of complex brain networks. However, little is known about the network of anatomical connections in the human brain. Here, we investigated large-scale anatomical connection patterns of the human cerebral cortex using cortical thickness measurements from magnetic resonance images. Two areas were considered anatomically connected if they showed statistically significant correlations in cortical thickness and we constructed the network of such connections using 124 brains from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping database. Significant short- and long-range connections were found in both intra- and interhemispheric regions, many of which were consistent with known neuroanatomical pathways measured by human diffusion imaging. More importantly, we showed that the human brain anatomical network had robust small-world properties with cohesive neighborhoods and short mean distances between regions that were insensitive to the selection of correlation thresholds. Additionally, we also found that this network and the probability of finding a connection between 2 regions for a given anatomical distance had both exponentially truncated power-law distributions. Our results demonstrated the basic organizational principles for the anatomical network in the human brain compatible with previous functional networks studies, which provides important implications of how functional brain states originate from their structural underpinnings. To our knowledge, this study provides the first report of small-world properties and degree distribution of anatomical networks in the human brain using cortical thickness measurements.},

	abstract = {A small-world network has been suggested to be an efficient solution for achieving both modular and global processing-a property highly desirable for brain computations. Here, we investigated functional networks of cortical neurons using correlation analysis to identify functional connectivity. To reconstruct the interaction network, we applied the Ising model based on the principle of maximum entropy. This allowed us to assess the interactions by measuring pairwise correlations and to assess the strength of coupling from the degree of synchrony. Visual responses were recorded in visual cortex of anesthetized cats, simultaneously from up to 24 neurons. First, pairwise correlations captured most of the patterns in the population's activity and, therefore, provided a reliable basis for the reconstruction of the interaction networks. Second, and most importantly, the resulting networks had small-world properties; the average path lengths were as short as in simulated random networks, but the clustering coefficients were larger. Neurons differed considerably with respect to the number and strength of interactions, suggesting the existence of "hubs" in the network. Notably, there was no evidence for scale-free properties. These results suggest that cortical networks are optimized for the coexistence of local and global computations: feature detection and feature integration or binding.},

Despite immense theoretical interest, little empirical evidence substantiates the biological importance of reciprocal altruism in non-human animals. We propose that this is because psychological mechanisms constrain its application in cooperative contexts. In particular, we contend that cognitive limitations such as temporal discounting, numerical discrimination and memory make reciprocity difficult for animals.},

In 'collective action', individuals engage in costly behaviour that benefits the group as a whole. Although the evolution of indirect reciprocity is theoretically plausible, there is no consensus about how collective action evolves. Evidence suggests that punishing free riders can maintain cooperation, but why individuals should engage in costly punishment is unclear. Solutions to this 'second-order free rider problem' include meta-punishment, mutation, conformism, signalling and group-selection. The threat of exclusion from indirect reciprocity can sustain collective action in the laboratory. Here, we show that such exclusion is evolutionarily stable, providing an incentive to engage in costly cooperation, while avoiding the second-order free rider problem because punishers can withhold help from free riders without damaging their reputations. However, we also show that such a strategy cannot invade a population in which indirect reciprocity is not linked to collective action, thus leaving unexplained how collective action arises.},

We show that honest signaling of underlying quality by providing a public good to group members can be evolutionarily stable, and can proliferate in a population in which it is initially rare, provided that certain plausible conditions hold, including a link between group-beneficial signaling and underlying qualities of the signaler that would be of benefit to a potential mate or alliance partner. Our model applies to a range of cooperative interactions, including unconditionally sharing individually consumable resources, participating in group raiding or defense, and punishing free-riding or other violations of social norms.},

Public goods experiments, which are used to study this type of problem, usually confirm that the collective benefit will not be produced. Because individuals and countries often participate in several social games simultaneously, the interaction of these games may provide a sophisticated way by which to maintain the public resource. Indirect reciprocity, 'give and you shall receive', is built on reputation and can sustain a high level of cooperation, as shown by game theorists. Here we show, through alternating rounds of public goods and indirect reciprocity games, that the need to maintain reputation for indirect reciprocity maintains contributions to the public good at an unexpectedly high level. But if rounds of indirect reciprocation are not expected, then contributions to the public good drop quickly to zero. Alternating the games leads to higher profits for all players. As reputation may be a currency that is valid in many social games, our approach could be used to test social dilemmas for their solubility.},

For each subject's data at each session, we used a wavelet filter to estimate the mutual information ({MI)} between each pair of {MEG} sensors in each of the classical frequency intervals from gamma to low delta in the overall range 1-60 Hz. Undirected binary graphs were generated by thresholding the {MI} matrix and 8 global network metrics were estimated: the clustering coefficient, path length, small-worldness, efficiency, cost-efficiency, assortativity, hierarchy, and synchronizability. Reliability of each graph metric was assessed using the intraclass correlation ({ICC).} Good reliability was demonstrated for most metrics applied to the n-back data (mean {ICC=0.62).} Reliability was greater for metrics in lower frequency networks. Higher frequency gamma- and beta-band networks were less reliable at a global level but demonstrated high reliability of nodal metrics in frontal and parietal regions. Performance of the n-back task was associated with greater reliability than measurements on resting state data. Task practice was also associated with greater reliability. Collectively these results suggest that graph metrics are sufficiently reliable to be considered for future longitudinal studies of functional brain network changes.},

	abstract = {Small-world networks are a class of networks that exhibit efficient long-distance communication and tightly interconnected local neighborhoods. In recent years, functional and structural brain networks have been examined using network theory-based methods, and consistently shown to have small-world properties. Moreover, some voxel-based brain networks exhibited properties of scale-free networks, a class of networks with mega-hubs. However, there are considerable inconsistencies across studies in the methods used and the results observed, particularly between region-based and voxel-based brain networks. We constructed functional brain networks at multiple resolutions using the same resting-state {fMRI} data, and compared various network metrics, degree distribution, and localization of nodes of interest. It was found that the networks with higher resolutions exhibited the properties of small-world networks more prominently. It was also found that voxel-based networks were more robust against network fragmentation compared to region-based networks. Although the degree distributions of all networks followed an exponentially truncated power law rather than true power law, the higher the resolution, the closer the distribution was to a power law. The voxel-based analyses also enhanced visualization of the results in the {3D} brain space. It was found that nodes with high connectivity tended have high efficiency, a co-localization of properties that was not as consistently observed in the region-based networks. Our results demonstrate benefits of constructing the brain network at the finest scale the experiment will permit.},

Information on structural networks in the brain can be obtained in-vivo by performing tractography on diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI)} data. However, little is known about the reproducibility of network properties derived from whole brain tractography data, which has important consequences for minimally detectable abnormalities or changes over time. Moreover, acquisition parameters, such as the number of gradient directions and gradient strength, possibly influence network metrics and the corresponding reproducibility derived from tractography data. The aim of the present study is twofold: (i) to determine the effect of several clinically available {DTI} sampling schemes, differing in number of gradient directions and gradient amplitude, on small world metrics and (ii) to evaluate the interscan reproducibility of small world metrics. {DTI} experiments were conducted on six healthy volunteers scanned twice. Probabilistic tractography was performed to reconstruct structural connections between regions defined from an anatomical atlas. The observed reproducibility of the network measures was high, reflected by low values for the coefficient of variation ({\textless}3.8\%), advocating the use of graph theoretical measurements to study neurological diseases. Small world metrics were dependent on the choice of {DTI} gradient scheme and showed stronger connectivity with increasing directional resolution. The interscan reproducibility was not dependent on the gradient scheme. These findings should be considered when comparing results across studies using different gradient schemes or designing new studies.},

A theoretical framework is perceived as particularly successful if it can explain very disparate facts. The observation that some apparently complex phenomena can exhibit startling similarities to dynamics generated with simple mathematical models (1) has led to empirical searches for fundamental laws by inspecting data for qualitative agreement with the behavior of such models. A striking feature that has attracted considerable attention is the apparent ubiquity of power-law relationships in empirical data. However, although power laws have been reported in areas ranging from finance and molecular biology to geophysics and the Internet, the data are typically insufficient and the mechanistic insights are almost always too limited for the identification of power-law behavior to be scientifically useful (see the figure). Indeed, even most statistically âsuccessfulâ calculations of power laws offer little more than anecdotal value.},

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distributionâthe part of the distribution representing large but rare eventsâand by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov ({KS)} statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.},

	abstract = {Advanced perceptual systems are faced with the problem of securing a principled (ideally, veridical) relationship between the world and its internal representation. I propose a unified approach to visual representation, addressing the need for superordinate and basic-level categorization and for the identification of specific instances of familiar categories. According to the proposed theory, a shape is represented internally by the responses of a small number of tuned modules, each broadly selective for some reference shape, whose similarity to the stimulus it measures. This amounts to embedding the stimulus in a low-dimensional proximal shape space spanned by the outputs of the active modules. This shape space supports representations of distal shape similarities that are veridical as Shepard's (1968) second-order isomorphisms (i.e., correspondence between distal and proximal similarities among shapes, rather than between distal shapes and their proximal representations). Representation in terms of similarities to reference shapes supports processing (e.g., discrimination) of shapes that are radically different from the reference ones, without the need for the computationally problematic decomposition into parts required by other theories. Furthermore, a general expression for similarity between two stimuli, based on comparisons to reference shapes, can be used to derive models of perceived similarity ranging from continuous, symmetric, and hierarchical ones, as in multidimensional scaling (Shepard 1980), to discrete and nonhierarchical ones, as in the general contrast models (Shepard \& Arabie 1979; Tversky 1977).},

	abstract = {The more than 1000-fold increase in the cortical surface without a comparable increase in its thickness during mammalian evolution can be explained in the context of the radial unit hypothesis of cortical development. Cortical expansion results from changes in the proliferation kinetics of founder cells in the ventricular zone that increase the number of radial columnar units without significantly changing the number of neurons within each unit. Thus, regulatory genes that control the timing (onset/rate/duration) and mode (symmetrical/asymmetrical) of cell divisions and the magnitude of programmed cell death (apoptosis) in the ventricular zone determine the number of cortical cells in a given species. The migration of postmitotic cells and their allocation into appropriate positions within the cortex is radially constrained by glial scaffolding and thereby creates an expanded cortical plate in the form of a sheet. Several families of genes and morphoregulatory molecules that control the production, migration and deployment of neurons within the developing cortical plate are being identified and their functions tested in vitro and in transgenic animals. The results provide a hint of how mutation of genes that regulate the early stages of corticogenesis may determine the species-specific size and basic organization of the cerebral cortex that sets the stage for the formation of the final pattern of its synaptic connections that can be validated through natural selection.},

The interpretation of such measurements is discussed, including an analytical study of the hierarchical node degree for random networks, and the potential of the suggested measurements for the characterization of complex networks is illustrated with respect to simulations of random, scale-free and regular network models as well as real data (airports, proteins and word associations). The enhanced characterization of the connectivity provided by the set of hierarchical measurements also allows the use of agglomerative clustering methods in order to obtain taxonomies of relationships between nodes in a network, a possibility which is also illustrated in the current article.},

A large number of real networks are referred to as 'scale-free' because they show a power-law distribution of the number of links per node. However, it is widely believed that complex networks are not invariant or self-similar under a length-scale transformation. This conclusion originates from the 'small-world' property of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases exponentially with the 'diameter' of the network, rather than the power-law relation expected for a self-similar structure. Here we analyse a variety of real complex networks and find that, on the contrary, they consist of self-repeating patterns on all length scales. This result is achieved by the application of a renormalization procedure that coarse-grains the system into boxes containing nodes within a given 'size'. We identify a power-law relation between the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box, defining a finite self-similar exponent. These fundamental properties help to explain the scale-free nature of complex networks and suggest a common self-organization dynamics.},

	abstract = {Methods that analyse the topological structure of networks have recently become quite popular. Whether motifs (subgraph patterns that occur more often than in randomized networks) have specific functions as elementary computational circuits has been cause for debate. As the question is difficult to resolve with currently available biological data, we approach the issue using networks that abstractly model natural genetic regulatory networks ({GRNs)} which are evolved to show dynamical behaviors. Specifically one group of networks was evolved to be capable of exhibiting two different behaviors ("differentiation") in contrast to a group with a single target behavior. In both groups we find motif distribution differences within the groups to be larger than differences between them, indicating that evolutionary niches (target functions) do not necessarily mold network structure uniquely. These results show that variability operators can have a stronger influence on network topologies than selection pressures, especially when many topologies can create similar dynamics. Moreover, analysis of motif functional relevance by lesioning did not suggest that motifs were of greater importance to the functioning of the network than arbitrary subgraph patterns. Only when drastically restricting network size, so that one motif corresponds to a whole functionally evolved network, was preference for particular connection patterns found. This suggests that in non-restricted, bigger networks, entanglement with the rest of the network hinders topological subgraph analysis.},

This continuum model proves to have a line of symmetry comparable with those found hitherto only in lattice models. The line is that of the diameter, or mean orthobaric density Ïâ = âÂ½Ï1â+âÂ½Ïg, below the critical point, and continues through the oneâphase region to infinite temperature. The existence of this line allows some of the properties to be obtained explicitly, the most unusual of which is that the diameter has a singularity comparable with that in CÏ; hence the law of the rectilinear diameter is not obeyed. An exact solution of the model is obtained in one dimension, in which there is no phase transition, and a meanâfield solution in three dimensions. The latter preserves the symmetry. The model is shown to be thermodynamically equivalent to a twoâcomponent system in which the pair potential between molecules of like species is zero, while that between molecules of unlike species implies a mutually excluded volume of Ï0. In this transcription the symmetry of the model becomes obvious.},

We introduce subgraph "intensity" as the geometric mean of its link weights "coherence" as the ratio of the geometric to the corresponding arithmetic mean. Using these measures, motif scores and clustering coefficient can be generalized to weighted networks. To demonstrate these concepts, we apply them to financial and metabolic networks and find that inclusion of weights may considerably modify the conclusions obtained from the study of unweighted characteristics.},

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as âmodularityâ over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well knownâa collaboration network and a food webâand find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

The process whereby input patterns are transformed and stored by competitive cellular networks is considered. This process arises in such diverse subjects as the shortterm storage of visual or language patterns by neural networks, pattern formation due to the firing of morphogenetic gradients in developmental biology, control of choice behavior during macromolecular evolution, and the design of stable context-sensitive parallel processors. In addition to systems capable of approaching one of perhaps infinitely many equilibrium points in response to arbitrary input patterns and initial data, one finds in these subjects a wide variety of other behaviors, notably traveling waves, standing waves, resonance, and chaos. The question of what general dynamical constraints cause global approach to equilibria rather than large amplitude waves is therefore of considerable interest. In another terminology, this is the question of whether global pattern formation occurs. A related question is whether the global pattern formation property persists when system parameters slowly change in an unpredictable fashion due to self-organization (development, learning). This is the question of absolute stability of global pattern formation. It is shown that many model systems which exhibit the absolute stability property can be written in the form},

An olog is similar to a relational database schema; in fact an olog can serve as a data repository if desired. Unlike database schemas, which are generally difficult to create or modify, ologs are designed to be user-friendly enough that authoring or reconfiguring an olog is a matter of course rather than a difficult chore. It is hoped that learning to author ologs is much simpler than learning a database definition language, despite their similarity. We describe ologs carefully and illustrate with many examples. As an application we show that any primitive recursive function can be described by an olog. We also show that ologs can be aligned or connected together into a larger network using functors. The various methods of information flow and institutions can then be used to integrate local and global world-views. We finish by providing several different avenues for future research.},

The study of such fluctuations could potentially provide insight into the brain's functional organization. In this article, we begin by presenting an overview of the strategies used to explore intrinsic neuronal activity. Considering the possibility that intrinsic signaling accounts for a large proportion of brain activity, we then examine whether the functional architecture of intrinsic activity is altered in neurological and psychiatric diseases. We also review a clinical application of brain mapping, in which intrinsic activity is employed for the preoperative localization of functional brain networks in patients undergoing neurosurgery. To end the article, we explore some of the basic science pursuits that have been undertaken to further understand the physiology behind intrinsic activity as imaged with {BOLD} {fMRI.}},

	abstract = {Background Like all other neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimerâs disease ({AD)} remains a very challenging and difficult problem for diagnosis and therapy. For many years, only historical, behavioral and psychiatric measures have been available to {AD} cases. Recently, a definitive diagnostic framework, using biomarkers and imaging, has been proposed. In this paper, we propose a promising diagnostic methodology for the framework. Methods In a previous paper, we developed an efficient {SVM} (Support Vector Machine) based method, which we have now applied to discover important biomarkers and target networks which provide strategies for {AD} therapy. Results The methodology selects a number of blood-based biomarkers (fewer than 10\% of initial numbers on three {AD} datasets from {NCBI)}, and the results are statistically verified by cross-validation. The resulting {SVM} is a classifier of {AD} vs. normal subjects. We construct target networks of {AD} based on {MI} (mutual information). In addition, a hierarchical clustering is applied on the initial data and clustered genes are visualized in a heatmap. The proposed method also performs gender analysis by classifying subjects based on gender. Conclusions Unlike other traditional statistical analyses, our method uses a machine learning-based algorithm. Our method selects a small set of important biomarkers for {AD}, differentiates noisy (irrelevant) from relevant biomarkers and also provides the target networks of the selected biomarkers, which will be useful for diagnosis and therapeutic design. Finally, based on the gender analysis, we observe that gender could play a role in {AD} diagnosis.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000217},
	abstract = {The advent of microarray technology has made it possible to classify disease states based on gene expression profiles of patients. Typically, marker genes are selected by measuring the power of their expression profiles to discriminate among patients of different disease states. However, expression-based classification can be challenging in complex diseases due to factors such as cellular heterogeneity within a tissue sample and genetic heterogeneity across patients. A promising technique for coping with these challenges is to incorporate pathway information into the disease classification procedure in order to classify disease based on the activity of entire signaling pathways or protein complexes rather than on the expression levels of individual genes or proteins. We propose a new classification method based on pathway activities inferred for each patient. For each pathway, an activity level is summarized from the gene expression levels of its condition-responsive genes ({CORGs)}, defined as the subset of genes in the pathway whose combined expression delivers optimal discriminative power for the disease phenotype. We show that classifiers using pathway activity achieve better performance than classifiers based on individual gene expression, for both simple and complex case-control studies including differentiation of perturbed from non-perturbed cells and subtyping of several different kinds of cancer. Moreover, the new method outperforms several previous approaches that use a static (i.e., non-conditional) definition of pathways. Within a pathway, the identified {CORGs} may facilitate the development of better diagnostic markers and the discovery of core alterations in human disease.},

	abstract = {The ultimate proof of our understanding of natural or technological systems is reflected in our ability to control them. Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the systemâs entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the networkâs degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.

	abstract = {In the diagnostic process of Alzheimer's disease ({AD)}, there may be considerable delays between first contact to outpatient services and a final, definitive diagnosis. In Europe the average delay is 20 months. Nevertheless, patient data preceding clinical {AD} diagnoses often contains early signs of the disease. Several studies have analyzed data of mild cognitive impairment ({MCI)} subjects, showing that conversion from {MCI} to {AD} can be predicted with a classification accuracy of 60â80\%. This accuracy may not be high enough for influencing diagnostic decisions. In this work, the prediction problem is approached differently; a target prediction accuracy is defined first and is then used for identifying {MCI} patients for whom the required accuracy can be reached. The process uses a novel disease state index method in which patient data are statistically compared to a high number of previously diagnosed cases. It is shown that the disease index values derived from heterogeneous patient data can be used for identifying groups of patients for whom the prediction accuracy reaches the previously set target level. The results also show that 12 months before receiving clinical {AD} diagnoses, approximately half (51.5\%, 95\% confidence interval: 48.6â54.2\%) of {MCI} subjects who progressed to {AD} can be classified with a high accuracy of 87.7\%, possibly enough to support earlier diagnostic decisions.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal volume change over time, measured with {MRI}, has huge potential as a marker for Alzheimer's disease. The objectives of this study were: (i) to test if constant and accelerated hippocampal loss can be detected in Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and normal ageing over short periods, e.g. 6-12 months, with {MRI} in the large multicentre setting of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI);} (ii) to determine the extent to which the polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E ({ApoE)} gene modulates hippocampal change; and (iii) to determine if rates of hippocampal loss correlate with cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, such as the beta-amyloid (Abeta(1-42)) and tau proteins (tau). The {MRI} multicentre study included 112 cognitive normal elderly individuals, 226 mild cognitive impairment and 96 Alzheimer's disease patients who all had at least three successive {MRI} scans, involving 47 different imaging centres. The mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease groups showed hippocampal volume loss over 6 months and accelerated loss over 1 year. Moreover, increased rates of hippocampal loss were associated with presence of the {ApoE} allele epsilon4 gene in Alzheimer's disease and lower {CSF} Abeta(1-42) in mild cognitive impairment, irrespective of {ApoE} genotype, whereas relations with tau were only trends. The power to measure hippocampal change was improved by exploiting correlations statistically between successive {MRI} observations. The demonstration of considerable hippocampal loss in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients over only 6 months and accelerated loss over 12 months illustrates the power of {MRI} to track morphological brain changes over time in a large multisite setting. Furthermore, the relations between faster hippocampal loss in the presence of {ApoE} allele epsilon4 and decreased {CSF} Abeta(1-42) supports the concept that increased hippocampal loss is an indicator of Alzheimer's disease pathology and a potential marker for the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in Alzheimer's disease.},

Atrophy of medial temporal structures is now considered to be a valid diagnostic marker at the mild cognitive impairment stage. Structural imaging is also included in diagnostic criteria for the most prevalent non-Alzheimer dementias, reflecting its value in differential diagnosis. In addition, rates of whole-brain and hippocampal atrophy are sensitive markers of neurodegeneration, and are increasingly used as outcome measures in trials of potentially disease-modifying therapies. Large multicenter studies are currently investigating the value of other imaging and nonimaging markers as adjuncts to clinical assessment in diagnosis and monitoring of progression. The utility of structural imaging and other markers will be increased by standardization of acquisition and analysis methods, and by development of robust algorithms for automated assessment.},

Several lines of evidence suggest that additional susceptibility genes exist for both early- and late-onset {AD}, however, none of the more than three dozen putative {AD} loci proposed to date have been consistently replicated in follow-up analyses. Novel {AD} genes will not only provide valuable clues for the development of novel therapeutic approaches, but will also allow the development of new genetic risk profiling strategies that are an essential prerequisite for early prediction/prevention of this devastating disease.

To determine whether there are alterations in brain mitochondrial metabolism associated with healthy aging, we combined {13C/1H} magnetic resonance spectroscopy with infusions of [1-{13C]glucose} and [2-{13C]acetate} to quantitatively characterize rates of neuronal and astroglial tricarboxylic acid cycles, as well as neuroglial glutamateâglutamine cycling, in healthy elderly and young volunteers. Compared with young subjects, neuronal mitochondrial metabolism and glutamateâglutamine cycle flux was {\textasciitilde}30\% lower in elderly subjects. The reduction in individual subjects correlated strongly with reductions in N-acetylaspartate and glutamate concentrations consistent with chronic reductions in brain mitochondrial function. In elderly subjects infused with [2-{13C]acetate} labeling of glutamine, C4 and C3 differed from that of the young subjects, indicating age-related changes in glial mitochondrial metabolism. Taken together, these studies show that healthy aging is associated with reduced neuronal mitochondrial metabolism and altered glial mitochondrial metabolism, which may in part be responsible for declines in brain function.},

In confronting the disease, early diagnosis and appropriate, timely therapeutic intervention are critical factors in ensuring favorable long-term outcomes. The availability of reliable biomarkers could radically alter our management of {MS} at critical phases of the disease spectrum. Identification of markers that could predict the development of {MS} in high-risk populations would allow for intervention strategies that may prevent evolution to definite disease. Work with anti-myelin antibodies and the ongoing analysis of microarray gene expression have thus far not yielded biomarkers that predict future disease development. Similarly, extensive studies with serum and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} have not yielded a disease-specific and sensitive diagnostic biomarker for {MS.} Establishment of disease diagnosis always leads to questions about long-term prognosis because in an individual patient the natural history of the disease is clinically unpredictable. Biomarkers that correlate with myelin loss, spinal cord disease, grey matter and subcortical demyelination need to be developed in order to accurately predict the disease course. The bulk of effort in biomarker development in {MS} has been concentrated in the area of monitoring disease activity. At present, a disease 'activation' panel of {CSF} biomarkers would include the following: interleukin-6 or its soluble receptor, nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase, osteopontin, and fetuin-A. Although disease activity in {MS} is predominantly inflammatory, disease progression is likely to be the result of neurodegeneration. Therefore, the roles of proteins indicative of neuronal, axonal, and glial loss such as neurofilaments, tau, 14-3-3 proteins, and N-acetylaspartate are all under investigation, as are proteins affecting remyelination and regeneration, such as Nogo-A. With the increasing awareness of cognition dysfunction in {MS}, molecules such as apolipoprotein and proteins in the amyloid precursor protein pathway implicated in dementia are also being examined. Serum biomarkers that help monitor therapeutic efficacy such as the titer of antibody to beta-interferon, a first-line medication in {MS}, are established in clinical practice. Ongoing work with biomarkers that reflect drug bioavailability and factors that distinguish between medication responders and nonresponders are also under investigation. The discovery of new biomarkers relies on applying advances in proteomics along with microarray gene and antigen analysis and will hopefully result in the establishment of specific biomarkers for {MS.}},

It provides an update on promising areas of biomarker research in a rapidly expanding field, and discusses future directions that might lead to successful development of Parkinson's disease biomarkers.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS:} Studies of molecular-genetic and biochemical biomarkers of Parkinson's disease have not only targeted hypothesis-driven measures of specific substrates involved in processes such as protein misprocessing, but also have made use of sophisticated analyses such as transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic approaches. Whereas none of these are yet established as Parkinson's disease biomarkers, brain imaging using the {123I-ioflupane} ligand with single-photon emission computed tomography was recently approved in the United States to aid in Parkinson's disease diagnosis, and research on other imaging modalities is ongoing. Neurophysiological tests are also being adapted for biomarker research, and we review recent promising data.
{SUMMARY:} The search for effective biomarkers for diagnosis and surveillance of Parkinson's disease continues. A battery of biomarkers comprising different modalities might be required to address clinical needs in this complex disorder. Critically, collaborative efforts including centralized tissue repository and clinical research infrastructure that are being organized will advance this field further.},

In this paper, we evaluated the performance of ten approaches (five voxel-based methods, three methods based on cortical thickness and two methods based on the hippocampus) using 509 subjects from the {ADNI} database. Three classification experiments were performed: {CN} vs {AD}, {CN} vs {MCIc} ({MCI} who had converted to {AD} within 18 months, {MCI} converters - {MCIc)} and {MCIc} vs {MCInc} ({MCI} who had not converted to {AD} within 18 months, {MCI} non-converters - {MCInc).} Data from 81 {CN}, 67 {MCInc}, 39 {MCIc} and 69 {AD} were used for training and hyperparameters optimization. The remaining independent samples of 81 {CN}, 67 {MCInc}, 37 {MCIc} and 68 {AD} were used to obtain an unbiased estimate of the performance of the methods. For {AD} vs {CN}, whole-brain methods (voxel-based or cortical thickness-based) achieved high accuracies (up to 81\% sensitivity and 95\% specificity). For the detection of prodromal {AD} ({CN} vs {MCIc)}, the sensitivity was substantially lower. For the prediction of conversion, no classifier obtained significantly better results than chance. We also compared the results obtained using the {DARTEL} registration to that using {SPM5} unified segmentation. {DARTEL} significantly improved six out of 20 classification experiments and led to lower results in only two cases. Overall, the use of feature selection did not improve the performance but substantially increased the computation times.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION:} Alzheimer's disease and other dementias represent a significant and increasing clinical challenge. Dementia is also associated with a substantial economic cost and burden to health service provision. Existing treatments slow the progression of symptoms of the disease, but their efficacy does not extend to all patients and is not sustained beyond an average of 6 months. It is, therefore, critical to address the current lack of effective treatments to target the underlying pathology and disease process in Alzheimer's disease.
{AREAS} {COVERED:} This review aims to highlight the main areas of new therapeutic development and discuss some of the main therapies currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Despite a number of promising rationales for therapeutic treatments in Alzheimer's disease, very few of these avenues have been developed beyond preclinical studies. The predominant focus of the current article is on treatments currently in Phase {II} and Phase {III} clinical trials, but some other promising areas of development are also discussed. There are currently only three therapeutics being investigated in Phase {III} clinical trials. This emphasizes the substantial caution and underinvestment in treatment development in this area.
{EXPERT} {OPINION:} There is a distinct lack of novel approaches in the pipeline, and whether there is a new disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease in the next 5 years almost entirely depends on the success of currently ongoing immunotherapy studies. Importantly, there is potential benefit in exploring existing licensed treatments alongside novel drug development to increase the focus on novel targets within this time frame.},

	abstract = {Of all forms of dementia, Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent. It is histopathologically characterized by beta-amyloid-containing plaques, tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles, reduced synaptic density and neuronal loss in selected brain areas. For the rare familial forms of Alzheimer's disease, pathogenic mutations have been identified in both the gene encoding the precursor of the Abeta peptide, {APP}, itself and in the presenilin genes which encode part of the {APP-protease} complex. For the more frequent sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease, the pathogenic trigger has not been unambiguously identified. Whether Abeta is again the main cause remains to be heavily discussed. In a related disorder termed frontotemporal dementia, which is characterized by tangles in the absence of beta-amyloid deposition, mutations have been identified in tau which also lead to neurodegeneration and dementia. For Alzheimer's disease the existence of familial forms lead to the proposition of the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which claims that beta-amyloid causes or enhances the tangle pathology. In this review, we describe tau transgenic mouse models in which aspects of the tau-associated pathology, including tangle formation, has been achieved. Moreover, tau transgenic mouse and tissue-culture models were used to test the amyloid cascade hypothesis. In addition, we discuss alternative hypotheses to explain the sporadic forms. The animal and tissue-culture models will provide insight into the underlying biochemical mechanisms of tau aggregation and nerve cell degeneration. These mechanisms may be partially shared between sporadic Alzheimer's disease, the familial forms and frontotemporal dementia. Eventually, Alzheimer's disease may be redefined based on biochemical events rather than phenotype.},

	abstract = {Changes in neuronal synchronization have been found in patients and animal models of Alzheimer's disease ({AD).} Synchronized behaviors within neuronal networks are important to such complex cognitive processes as working memory. The mechanisms behind these changes are not understood but may involve the action of soluble Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) on electrical networks. In order to determine if AÎ² can induce changes in neuronal synchronization, the activities of pyramidal neurons were recorded in rat prefrontal cortical ({PFC)} slices under calcium-free conditions using multi-neuron patch clamp technique. Electrical network activities and synchronization among neurons were significantly inhibited by low dose AÎ²42 (1 {nM)} and initially by high dose AÎ²42 (500 {nM).} However, prolonged application of high dose AÎ²42 resulted in network activation and tonic firing. Underlying these observations, we discovered that prolonged application of low and high doses of AÎ²42 induced opposite changes in action potential ({AP)-threshold} and after-hyperpolarization ({AHP)} of neurons. Accordingly, low dose AÎ²42 significantly increased the {AP-threshold} and deepened the {AHP}, making neurons less excitable. In contrast, high dose AÎ²42 significantly reduced the {AP-threshold} and shallowed the {AHP}, making neurons more excitable. These results support a model that low dose AÎ²42 released into the interstitium has a physiologic feedback role to dampen electrical network activity by reducing neuronal excitability. Higher concentrations of AÎ²42 over time promote supra-synchronization between individual neurons by increasing their excitability. The latter may disrupt frontal-based cognitive processing and in some cases lead to epileptiform discharges.},

	abstract = {Emergence, a concept that first appeared in philosophy, has been widely explored in the domain of complex systems and is sometimes considered to be the key ingredient that makes âcomplex systems â âcomplexâ. Our goal in this paper is to give a broad survey of emergence definitions, to extract a shared definition structure and to discuss some of the remaining issues. We do not know of any comparable surveys about the emergence concept. For this presentation, we start from a broadly applicable approach and finish with more specific propositions. We first present five selected works with a short analysis of each. We then propose a merged analysis in which we isolate a common structure through all definitions but also what we think needs further research. Finally, we briefly describe some perspectives about the emergence engine idea also referred to as emergent engineering.},

	abstract = {Causal interactions within complex systems can be analyzed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. For example, the brain can be analyzed at the level of neurons, neuronal groups, and areas, over tens, hundreds, or thousands of milliseconds. It is widely assumed that, once a micro level is fixed, macro levels are fixed too, a relation called supervenience. It is also assumed that, although macro descriptions may be convenient, only the micro level is causally complete, because it includes every detail, thus leaving no room for causation at the macro level. However, this assumption can only be evaluated under a proper measure of causation. Here, we use a measure [effective information ({EI)]} that depends on both the effectiveness of a systemâs mechanisms and the size of its state space: {EI} is higher the more the mechanisms constrain the systemâs possible past and future states. By measuring {EI} at micro and macro levels in simple systems whose micro mechanisms are fixed, we show that for certain causal architectures {EI} can peak at a macro level in space and/or time. This happens when coarse-grained macro mechanisms are more effective (more deterministic and/or less degenerate) than the underlying micro mechanisms, to an extent that overcomes the smaller state space. Thus, although the macro level supervenes upon the micro, it can supersede it causally, leading to genuine causal emergenceâthe gain in {EI} when moving from a micro to a macro level of analysis.},

	abstract = {Because the basic unit of biology is the cell, biological knowledge is rooted in the epistemology of the cell, and because life is the salient characteristic of the cell, its epistemology must be centered on its livingness, not its constituent components. The organization and regulation of these components in the pursuit of life constitute the fundamental nature of the cell. Thus, regulation sits at the heart of biological knowledge of the cell and the extraordinary complexity of this regulation conditions the kind of knowledge that can be obtained, in particular, the representation and intelligibility of that knowledge. This paper is essentially split into two parts. The first part discusses the inadequacy of everyday intelligibility and intuition in science and the consequent need for scientific theories to be expressed mathematically without appeal to commonsense categories of understanding, such as causality. Having set the backdrop, the second part addresses biological knowledge. It briefly reviews modern scientific epistemology from a general perspective and then turns to the epistemology of the cell. In analogy with a multi-faceted factory, the cell utilizes a highly parallel distributed control system to maintain its organization and regulate its dynamical operation in the face of both internal and external changes. Hence, scientific knowledge is constituted by the mathematics of stochastic dynamical systems, which model the overall relational structure of the cell and how these structures evolve over time, stochasticity being a consequence of the need to ignore a large number of factors while modeling relatively few in an extremely complex environment.},

These insights are then generalized. A priori, there is no privileged level of causation. The relations between this form of âbiological relativityâ and forms of relativity in physics are discussed. Biological relativity can be seen as an extension of the relativity principle by avoiding the assumption that there is a privileged scale at which biological functions are determined.},

This preference is driven both by the intractability of cancer to generic therapies, assumed to be due to the highly varied molecular etiologies observed in cancer, and by the opportunity to discern and dissect the regulatory and control interactions presented by the highly diverse assortment of perturbations of regulation and control that arise in cancer. Exploiting the opportunities for inference on the regulatory and control connections offered by these revealing system perturbations is fraught with the practical problems that arise from the way biological systems operate. Two classes of regulatory action in biological systems are particularly inimical to inference, convergent regulation, where a variety of regulatory actions result in a common set of control responses (crosstalk), and divergent regulation, where a single regulatory action produces entirely different sets of control responses, depending on cellular context (conditioning). We have constructed a coarse mathematical model of the propagation of regulatory influence in such distributed, context-sensitive regulatory networks that allows a quantitative estimation of the amount of crosstalk and conditioning associated with a candidate regulatory gene taken from a set of genes that have been profiled over a series of samples where the candidate' s activity varies.},

We propose the regulatorâreaction equations combined with detailed attributes including the associated cellular component, molecular function, and biological process and present the simulation-directed graphical notation that is derived from modification of Kohnâs method. We have developed the software suite, {CADLIVE} (Computer-Aided Design of {LIVing} {systEms)}, which features a graphical user interface ({GUI)} to edit large-scale maps of complicated signal transduction pathways using a conventional {XML-based} representation. The regulatorâreaction equations represent not only mechanistic reactions, but also semantic models containing ambiguous and incomplete processes. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of {CADLIVE}, we constructed a detailed map of the budding yeast cell cycle, which consists of 184 molecules and 152 reactions, in a really compact space. {CADLIVE} enables one to look at the whole view of a large-scale map, to integrate postgenomic data into the map, and to computationally simulate the signal transduction pathways, which greatly facilitates exploring novel or unexpected interactions.},

{RESULTS:} Compared with placebo, the combination of fluoxetine with {CBT} was statistically significant (P =.001) on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised. Compared with fluoxetine alone (P =.02) and {CBT} alone (P =.01), treatment of fluoxetine with {CBT} was superior. Fluoxetine alone is a superior treatment to {CBT} alone (P =.01). Rates of response for fluoxetine with {CBT} were 71.0\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 62\%-80\%); fluoxetine alone, 60.6\% (95\% {CI}, 51\%-70\%); {CBT} alone, 43.2\% (95\% {CI}, 34\%-52\%); and placebo, 34.8\% (95\% {CI}, 26\%-44\%). On the Clinical Global Impressions improvement responder analysis, the 2 fluoxetine-containing conditions were statistically superior to {CBT} and to placebo. Clinically significant suicidal thinking, which was present in 29\% of the sample at baseline, improved significantly in all 4 treatment groups. Fluoxetine with {CBT} showed the greatest reduction (P =.02). Seven (1.6\%) of 439 patients attempted suicide; there were no completed suicides.
{CONCLUSION:} The combination of fluoxetine with {CBT} offered the most favorable tradeoff between benefit and risk for adolescents with major depressive disorder.},

This question was much studied in the 1960s but was never answered, and more recent characterizations of concepts as prototypes rather than logical rules leave it unsolved. Here I investigate this question in the domain of Boolean concepts (categories defined by logical rules). A series of experiments measured the subjective difficulty of a wide range of logical varieties of concepts (41 mathematically distinct types in six familiesâa far wider range than has been tested previously). The data reveal a surprisingly simple empirical 'law': the subjective difficulty of a concept is directly proportional to its Boolean complexity (the length of the shortest logically equivalent propositional formula)âthat is, to its logical incompressibility.},

The experiment to be reported was designed primarily to answer two questions: How does the difficulty of learning vary from one type of classification to another? Is something specific learned about the structure of a classification that will transfer positively to the subsequent learning of a new classification of that same type? The experimental procedure conformed to the usual paired-associate paradigm except that only two responses were used. That is, the eight stimuli were presented, one at a time, in a continuing random sequence and an association between each stimulus and one of two alternative classificatory responses was built up by the method of anticipation. Six female freshmen at Fairleigh Dickinson University served for 15 hours each in this first experiment. These subjects (Ss) were selected to be as uniform as possible with respect to their college entrance examination scores. A combined empirical and theoretical investigation of the difficulties of different kinds of classifications was undertaken using both learning and memory tasks. Sets of stimuli of a variety of kinds were used but, in each set, there were eight stimuli each of which took on one of two possible values on each of three different dimensions. Results showed that of the 70 possible classifications of the eight stimuli into two equal groups, there are only six basic types. The different classifications belonging to any one of these types have the same structure; they differ only with respect to which of the three dimensions is assigned to which of the three roles in the classification, and with respect to which of the two classificatory responses is assigned to which group of four stimuli.},

This model refers to a decision-making process and to the idea that military victory goes to the side that can complete the cycle from observation to action the fastest.  This book aims to redress this state of affairs and re-examines John Boydâs original contribution to strategic theory. By highlighting diverse sources that shaped Boydâs thinking, and by offering a comprehensive overview of Boydâs work, this volume demonstrates that the common interpretation of the meaning of Boydâs OODA loop concept is incomplete. It also shows that Boydâs work is much more comprehensive, richer and deeper than is generally thought. With his ideas featuring in the literature on Network Centric Warfare, a key element of the US and NATOâs so-called âmilitary transformationâ programmes, as well as in the debate on Fourth Generation Warfare, Boyd continues to exert a strong influence on Western military thinking. Dr Osinga demonstrates how Boydâs work can helps us to understand the new strategic threats in the post- 9/11 world, and establishes why John Boyd should be regarded as one of the most important (post)modern strategic theorists.},

Bernard Baars (1988), Edelman and Tononi (2000), and many others, have written such, and done it well indeed. This book, rather, brings the powerful analytic machinery of communication theory to bear on the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) model of consciousness which Baars introduced, and does so in a formal mathematical manner. It is not the first such attempt. The philospher Fred Dretske (1981), indep- dent of Baars, long ago outlined how information theory might illuminate the understanding of mind. Adapting his approach on the necessary conditions for mental process, we apply a previously-developed information theory analysis of interacting cognitive biological and social modules to Baars' GNW, which has become the principal candidate for a 'standard model' of consciousness. Invoking an obvious canonical homology with statistical physics, the method, when iterated in the spirit of the Hierarchical Linear Model of regression theory, generates a fluctuating dynamic threshold for consciousness which is similar to a tunable phase transition in a physical system. The phenomenon is, however, constrained to a manifold/atlas structure analogous to a retina; an adaptable Rate Distortion manifold, whose 'topology', in a large sense, reflects the hierarchy of embedding constraints acting on consciousness. This view greatly extends what Baars has characterized as 'contexts.},

This supposition is in contrast with current understanding that DMN activated when the subjects are resting and deactivated during any attention-demanding cognitive tasks. To test our proposal, we used, in retrospect, the results from our two early studies (Fingelkurts, 1998; Fingelkurts et al., 2003). In both studies for the majority of experimental trails we indeed found a constellation of operationally synchronized cortical areas (indexed as DMN) that was persistent across all studied experimental conditions in all subjects. Furthermore, we found three major elements comprising this DMN: two symmetrical occipito-parieto-temporal and one frontal spatio-temporal patterns. This new data directly supports the notion that DMN has a specific functional connotation â it provides neurophysiologic basis for self-processing operations, namely first-person perspective taking and an experience of agency.},

In contrast to the widely used general linear model (GLM) that requires the user to parameterize the data (e.g. the brain's response to stimuli), ICA, by relying upon a general assumption of independence, allows the user to be agnostic regarding the exact form of the response. In addition, ICA is intrinsically a multivariate approach, and hence each component provides a grouping of brain activity into regions that share the same response pattern thus providing a natural measure of functional connectivity. There are a wide variety of ICA approaches that have been proposed, in this paper we focus upon two distinct methods. The first part of this paper reviews the use of ICA for making group inferences from fMRI data. We provide an overview of current approaches for utilizing ICA to make group inferences with a focus upon the group ICA approach implemented in the GIFT software. In the next part of this paper, we provide an overview of the use of ICA to combine or fuse multimodal data. ICA has proven particularly useful for data fusion of multiple tasks or data modalities such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data or event-related potentials. As demonstrated by a number of examples in this paper, ICA is a powerful and versatile data-driven approach for studying the brain.},

The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms for interrogating the myriad functional systems in the brain without the constraints of a priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) constitutes a candidate approach capable of addressing this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude spontaneous low-frequency ({\textless}0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the fMRI signal that are temporally correlated across functionally related areas. Referred to as functional connectivity, these correlations yield detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting an individual's "functional connectome." Reproducibility across datasets and individuals suggests the functional connectome has a common architecture, yet each individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features, with stable, meaningful interindividual differences in connectivity patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome, and its subsequent exploitation to discern genetic influences and brain-behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative datasets. Here we initiate this endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international centers. We demonstrate a universal architecture of positive and negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual variability. Age and sex emerged as significant determinants. These results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can be aggregated and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide quantitative phenotypes for molecular genetic studies and biomarkers of developmental and pathological processes in the brain.

	abstract = {In the past decade, resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) measures of brain activity have attracted considerable attention. Based on changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal, R-fMRI offers a novel way to assess the brain's spontaneous or intrinsic (i.e., task-free) activity with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. The properties of both the intra- and inter-regional connectivity of resting-state brain activity have been well documented, promoting our understanding of the brain as a complex network. Specifically, the topological organization of brain networks has been recently studied with graph theory. In this review, we will summarize the recent advances in graph-based brain network analyses of R-fMRI signals, both in typical and atypical populations. Application of these approaches to R-fMRI data has demonstrated non-trivial topological properties of functional networks in the human brain. Among these is the knowledge that the brain's intrinsic activity is organized as a small-world, highly efficient network, with significant modularity and highly connected hub regions. These network properties have also been found to change throughout normal development, aging, and in various pathological conditions. The literature reviewed here suggests that graph-based network analyses are capable of uncovering system-level changes associated with different processes in the resting brain, which could provide novel insights into the understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms of brain function. We also highlight several potential research topics in the future.},

The MNI single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates, and (3) percentage of voxels belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an activated cluster.

We believe that this tool is an improvement for the macroscopical labeling of activated area compared to labeling assessed using the Talairach atlas brain in which deformations are well known. However, this tool does not alleviate the need for more sophisticated labeling strategies based on anatomical or cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps.},

The relation between the activity levels and the pattern of causal interaction among the DMN areas remains unknown. In the present fMRI study, seven nodes of the DMN were identified and their activity levels were rank-ordered based on a power spectral analysis of the resting blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Furthermore, the direction of information flow among these DMN nodes was determined using Granger causality analysis and graph-theoretic methods. We found that the activity levels in these seven DMN nodes had a highly consistent hierarchical distribution, with the highest activity level in the posterior cingulate/precuneus cortices, followed by ventral medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, and with the lowest level in the left inferior temporal gyrus. Importantly, a significant correlation was found between the activity levels and the In-Out degrees of information flow across the DMN nodes, suggesting that Granger causal influences can be used to predict BOLD activity levels. These findings shed light on the dynamical organization of cortical neuronal networks and may provide the basis for characterizing network disruption by brain disorders.},

Every year, millions of people suffer the consequences of brain damage, as a
result of stroke, traumatic brain injury, cancer or degenerative brain disease.
The cognitive and behavioral symptoms of focal lesions of the brain are highly
variable and in many cases depend on the location of the lesion site. Can we
predict the functional impact of such lesions on the basis of a computational
model of the brain's structure and dynamics? Numerous other systems
that form complex networks have been analyzed for their vulnerability to
structural damage. In many cases, the degree to which such systems are perturbed
depends on network attributes of the deleted nodes and connections. We apply
this network approach to investigate the structural and functional impact of
localized lesions of a model of the cerebral cortex. When we delete nodes that
occupy, in the intact brain, a highly central position, we find that the dynamic
interactions between nodes in the remaining brain are greatly disturbed. In
contrast, deletion of less central nodes has relatively little effect. In the
model, some of the most disruptive lesion sites correspond to locations in the
brain where lesions produce complex cognitive disturbances. Our modeling
approach aims towards linking disturbances of structural brain networks to
specific clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {Brain networks or âconnectomesâ include a minority of highly connected hub nodes that are functionally valuable, because their topological centrality supports integrative processing and adaptive behaviours. Recent studies also suggest that hubs have higher metabolic demands and longer-distance connections than other brain regions, and therefore could be considered biologically costly. Assuming that hubs thus normally combine both high topological value and high biological cost, we predicted that pathological brain lesions would be concentrated in hub regions. To test this general hypothesis, we first identified the hubs of brain anatomical networks estimated from diffusion tensor imaging data on healthy volunteers (n = 56), and showed that computational attacks targeted on hubs disproportionally degraded the efficiency of brain networks compared to random attacks. We then prepared grey matter lesion maps, based on meta-analyses of published magnetic resonance imaging data on more than 20 000 subjects and 26 different brain disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging lesions that were common across all brain disorders were more likely to be located in hubs of the normal brain connectome (P {\textless} 10â4, permutation test). Specifically, nine brain disorders had lesions that were significantly more likely to be located in hubs (P {\textless} 0.05, permutation test), including schizophrenia and Alzheimerâs disease. Both these disorders had significantly hub-concentrated lesion distributions, although (almost completely) distinct subsets of cortical hubs were lesioned in each disorder: temporal lobe hubs specifically were associated with higher lesion probability in Alzheimerâs disease, whereas in schizophrenia lesions were concentrated in both frontal and temporal cortical hubs. These results linking pathological lesions to the topological centrality of nodes in the normal diffusion tensor imaging connectome were generally replicated when hubs were defined instead by the meta-analysis of more than 1500 task-related functional neuroimaging studies of healthy volunteers to create a normative functional co-activation network. We conclude that the high cost/high value hubs of human brain networks are more likely to be anatomically abnormal than non-hubs in many (if not all) brain disorders.},

Here, we apply analytic measures of network communication to the structural connectivity of the human brain and explore the capacity of these measures to predict resting-state functional connectivity across three independently acquired datasets. We focus on the layout of shortest paths across the network and on two communication measuresâsearch information and path transitivityâwhich account for how these paths are embedded in the rest of the network. Search information is an existing measure of information needed to access or trace shortest paths; we introduce path transitivity to measure the density of local detours along the shortest path. We find that both search information and path transitivity predict the strength of functional connectivity among both connected and unconnected node pairs. They do so at levels that match or significantly exceed path length measures, Euclidean distance, as well as computational models of neural dynamics. This capacity suggests that dynamic couplings due to interactions among neural elements in brain networks are substantially influenced by the broader network context adjacent to the shortest communication pathways.},

	abstract = {Brain connectivity loss due to traumatic brain injury, stroke or multiple sclerosis can have serious consequences on life quality and a measurable impact upon neural and cognitive function. Though brain network properties are known to be affected disproportionately by injuries to certain gray matter regions, the manner in which white matter (WM) insults affect such properties remains poorly understood. Here, network-theoretic analysis allows us to identify the existence of a macroscopic neural connectivity core in the adult human brain which is particularly sensitive to network lesioning. The systematic lesion analysis of brain connectivity matrices from diffusion neuroimaging over a large sample (N = 110) reveals that the global vulnerability of brain networks can be predicated upon the extent to which injuries disrupt this connectivity core, which is found to be quite distinct from the set of connections between rich club nodes in the brain. Thus, in addition to connectivity within the rich club, the brain as a network also contains a distinct core scaffold of network edges consisting of WM connections whose damage dramatically lowers the integrative properties of brain networks. This pattern of core WM fasciculi whose injury results in major alterations to overall network integrity presents new avenues for clinical outcome prediction following brain injury by relating lesion locations to connectivity core disruption and implications for recovery. The findings of this study contribute substantially to current understanding of the human WM connectome, its sensitivity to injury, and clarify a long-standing debate regarding the relative prominence of gray vs. WM regions in the context of brain structure and connectomic architecture.},

	abstract = {The mature human brain is organized into a collection of specialized functional networks that flexibly interact to support various cognitive functions. Studies of development often attempt to identify the organizing principles that guide the maturation of these functional networks. In this report, we combine resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI), graph analysis, community detection, and spring-embedding visualization techniques to analyze four separate networks defined in earlier studies. As we have previously reported, we find, across development, a trend toward 'segregation' (a general decrease in correlation strength) between regions close in anatomical space and 'integration' (an increased correlation strength) between selected regions distant in space. The generalization of these earlier trends across multiple networks suggests that this is a general developmental principle for changes in functional connectivity that would extend to large-scale graph theoretic analyses of large-scale brain networks. Communities in children are predominantly arranged by anatomical proximity, while communities in adults predominantly reflect functional relationships, as defined from adult fMRI studies. In sum, over development, the organization of multiple functional networks shifts from a local anatomical emphasis in children to a more "distributed" architecture in young adults. We argue that this "local to distributed" developmental characterization has important implications for understanding the development of neural systems underlying cognition. Further, graph metrics (e.g., clustering coefficients and average path lengths) are similar in child and adult graphs, with both showing "small-world"-like properties, while community detection by modularity optimization reveals stable communities within the graphs that are clearly different between young children and young adults. These observations suggest that early school age children and adults both have relatively efficient systems that may solve similar information processing problems in divergent ways.},

In this study, we investigated graph theory metrics of functional integration (path length), functional segregation (clustering coefficient), and functional distinctness (modularity) as a function of disease severity. Further, we assessed whether these graph metrics were affected in cognitively normal participants with cerebrospinal fluid evidence of preclinical AD. Clustering coefficient and modularity, but not path length, were reduced in AD. Cognitively normal participants who harbored AD biomarker pathology also showed reduced values in these graph measures, demonstrating brain changes similar to, but smaller than, symptomatic AD. Only modularity was significantly affected by age. We also demonstrate that AD has a particular effect on hub-like regions in the brain.

However, no study has yet determined if topological properties of FNC are also altered in SZ. In this study, small-world network metrics of FNC during the resting state were examined in both healthy controls (HCs) and SZ subjects. FMRI data were obtained from 19 HCs and 19 SZ. Brain images were decomposed into independent components (ICs) by group independent component analysis (ICA). FNC maps were constructed via a partial correlation analysis of ICA time courses. A set of undirected graphs were built by thresholding the FNC maps and the small-world network metrics of these maps were evaluated. Our results demonstrated significantly altered topological properties of FNC in SZ relative to controls. In addition, topological measures of many ICs involving frontal, parietal, occipital and cerebellar areas were altered in SZ relative to controls. Specifically, topological measures of whole network and specific components in SZ were correlated with scores on the negative symptom scale of the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). These findings suggest that aberrant architecture of small-world brain topology in SZ consists of ICA temporally coherent brain networks.},

Specifically, we evaluated both short-term ({\textless}1 hour apart) and long-term ({\textgreater}5 months apart) TRT reliability for 12 global and 6 local nodal network metrics. We found that reliability of global network metrics was overall low, threshold-sensitive and dependent on several factors of scanning time interval (TI, long-term{\textgreater}short-term), network membership (NM, networks excluding negative correlations{\textgreater}networks including negative correlations) and network type (NT, binarized networks{\textgreater}weighted networks). The dependence was modulated by another factor of node definition (ND) strategy. The local nodal reliability exhibited large variability across nodal metrics and a spatially heterogeneous distribution. Nodal degree was the most reliable metric and varied the least across the factors above. Hub regions in association and limbic/paralimbic cortices showed moderate TRT reliability. Importantly, nodal reliability was robust to above-mentioned four factors. Simulation analysis revealed that global network metrics were extremely sensitive (but varying degrees) to noise in functional connectivity and weighted networks generated numerically more reliable results in compared with binarized networks. For nodal network metrics, they showed high resistance to noise in functional connectivity and no NT related differences were found in the resistance. These findings provide important implications on how to choose reliable analytical schemes and network metrics of interest.},

Whole-brain networks were created individually by parcellating the brain into 90 cerebral regions and obtaining pairwise connectivity. First, we studied age-associations in interregional connectivity and their relationship with the length of the connections. Aging was associated with less connectivity in the long-range connections of fronto-parietal and fronto-occipital systems and with higher connectivity of the short-range connections within frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. We also used the graph theory to measure functional integration and segregation. The pattern of the overall age-related correlations presented positive correlations of average minimum path length (r = 0.380, p = 0.008) and of global clustering coefficients (r = 0.454, p {\textless} 0.001), leading to less integrated and more segregated global networks. Main correlations in clustering coefficients were located in the frontal and parietal lobes. Higher clustering coefficients of some areas were related to lower performance in verbal and visual memory functions. In conclusion, we found that older participants showed lower connectivity of long-range connections together with higher functional segregation of these same connections, which appeared to indicate a more local clustering of information processing. Higher local clustering in older participants was negatively related to memory performance.},

	abstract = {Functional network connectivity (FNC) is a method of analyzing the temporal relationship of anatomical brain components, comparing the synchronicity between patient groups or conditions. We use functional-connectivity measures between independent components to classify between Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls during resting-state. Connectivity is measured using a variety of graph-theoretic connectivity measures such as graph density, average path length, and small-worldness. The Schizophrenia patients showed significantly less clustering (transitivity) among components than healthy controls (p {\textless} 0.05, corrected) with networks less likely to be connected, and also showed lower small-world connectivity than healthy controls. Using only these connectivity measures, an SVM classifier (without parameter tuning) could discriminate between Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls with 65\% accuracy, compared to 51\% chance. This implies that the global functional connectivity between resting-state networks is altered in Schizophrenia, with networks more likely to be disconnected and behave dissimilarly for diseased patients. We present this research finding as a tutorial using the publicly available COBRE dataset of 146 Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, provided as part of the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project. We demonstrate preprocessing, using independent component analysis (ICA) to nominate networks, computing graph-theoretic connectivity measures, and finally using these connectivity measures to either classify between patient groups or assess between-group differences using formal hypothesis testing. All necessary code is provided for both running command-line FSL preprocessing, and for computing all statistical measures and SVM classification within R. Collectively, this work presents not just findings of diminished FNC among resting-state networks in Schizophrenia, but also a practical connectivity tutorial.},

	abstract = {The human brain is a large-scale integrated network in the functional and structural domain. Graph theoretical analysis provides a novel framework for analysing such complex networks. While previous neuroimaging studies have uncovered abnormalities in several specific brain networks in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy characterized by tonicâclonic seizures, little is known about changes in whole-brain functional and structural connectivity networks. Regarding functional and structural connectivity, networks are intimately related and share common small-world topological features. We predict that patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy would exhibit a decoupling between functional and structural networks. In this study, 26 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy characterized by tonicâclonic seizures and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signal correlations and diffusion tensor image tractography were used to generate functional and structural connectivity networks. Graph theoretical analysis revealed that the patients lost optimal topological organization in both functional and structural connectivity networks. Moreover, the patients showed significant increases in nodal topological characteristics in several cortical and subcortical regions, including mesial frontal cortex, putamen, thalamus and amygdala relative to controls, supporting the hypothesis that regions playing important roles in the pathogenesis of epilepsy may display abnormal hub properties in network analysis. Relative to controls, patients showed further decreases in nodal topological characteristics in areas of the default mode network, such as the posterior cingulate gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus. Most importantly, the degree of coupling between functional and structural connectivity networks was decreased, and exhibited a negative correlation with epilepsy duration in patients. Our findings suggest that the decoupling of functional and structural connectivity may reflect the progress of long-term impairment in idiopathic generalized epilepsy, and may be used as a potential biomarker to detect subtle brain abnormalities in epilepsy. Overall, our results demonstrate for the first time that idiopathic generalized epilepsy is reflected in a disrupted topological organization in large-scale brain functional and structural networks, thus providing valuable information for better understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of generalized tonicâclonic seizures.},

Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have identified several resting-state networks, including the default mode network (DMN), which contains a set of cortical regions that interact with a hippocampus (HC) subsystem. Age-related alterations in the functional architecture of the DMN and HC may influence memory functions and possibly constitute a sensitive biomarker of forthcoming memory deficits. However, the exact form of DMN-HC alterations in aging and concomitant memory deficits is largely unknown. Here, using both task and resting data from 339 participants (25â80 y old), we have demonstrated age-related decrements in resting-state functional connectivity across most parts of the DMN, except for the HC network for which age-related elevation of connectivity between left and right HC was found along with attenuated HCâcortical connectivity. Elevated HC connectivity at rest, which was partly accounted for by age-related decline in white matter integrity of the fornix, was associated with lower cross-sectional episodic memory performance and declining longitudinal memory performance over 20 y. Additionally, elevated HC connectivity at rest was associated with reduced HC neural recruitment and HCâcortical connectivity during active memory encoding, which suggests that strong HC connectivity restricts the degree to which the HC interacts with other brain regions during active memory processing revealed by task fMRI. Collectively, our findings suggest a model in which age-related disruption in corticoâhippocampal functional connectivity leads to a more functionally isolated HC at rest, which translates into aberrant hippocampal decoupling and deficits during mnemonic processing.},

We wanted to directly address how changes in hippocampal-cortical versus striatal-cortical networks over time impact episodic memory with age. We followed 119 healthy participants (20â83 years) for 3.5 years with repeated tests of episodic verbal memory and magnetic resonance imaging for quantification of functional and structural connectivity and regional brain atrophy. While hippocampal-cortical functional connectivity predicted memory change in young, changes in cortico-striatal functional connectivity were related to change in recall in older adults. Within each age group, effects of functional and structural connectivity were anatomically closely aligned. Interestingly, the relationship between functional connectivity and memory was strongest in the age ranges where the rate of reduction of the relevant brain structure was lowest, implying selective impacts of the different brain events on memory. Together, these findings suggest a partly sequential and partly simultaneous model of brain events underlying cognitive changes in aging, where different functional and structural events are more or less important in various time windows, dismissing a simple uni-factorial view on neurocognitive aging.},

We hypothesized that functional connectivity of intrinsic brain activity in the "default-mode" network (DMN) is affected by normal aging and that this relates to cognitive function. Ten younger and 22 older subjects were scanned at "rest," that is, lying awake with eyes closed. Our results show decreased activity in older versus younger subjects in 2 resting-state networks (RSNs) resembling the previously described DMN, containing the superior and middle frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate, middle temporal gyrus, and the superior parietal region. These results remain significant after correction for RSN-specific gray matter volume. The relevance of these findings is illustrated by the correlation between reduced activity of one of these RSNs and less effective executive functioning/processing speed in the older group.},

The aim of this study was to identify effects of normal aging on the DMN using different methods of fMRI processing and evaluation.
METHODS: fMRI was acquired in 17 young and 21 old healthy subjects and the data were analyzed with (a) volumes of interest (VOI)-based signal time course and (b) independent component analyses (ICA). In the first approach, the strength of DMN region inter-connectivity (as expressed with correlation coefficients) was of primary interest, the second method provided a measure of the magnitude of DMN co-activation.
RESULTS: The older subjects exhibited significantly lower DMN activity in the posterior cingulate (PCC, t-test P{\textless}.001) as well as a tendency to lower activity in all other DMN regions in comparison to the younger subjects. We found no significant effect of age on DMN inter-connectivity.
CONCLUSION: Effects of normal aging such as loss of PCC co-activity could be detected by ICA, but not by signal time course correlation analyses of DMN inter-connectivity. This either indicates lower sensitivity of inter-connectivity measures to detect subtle DMN changes or indicate that ICA and time course analyses determine different properties of DMN co-activation. Our results, therefore, provide fundamental knowledge for a potential future use of functional MRI as biomarker for neurodegenerative dementias where diminished DMN activity needs to be reliably differentiated from that observed in health aging.},

Data were obtained from 14 patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis and focal unilateral medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Correlation coefficients between left and right hippocampal BOLD signal fluctuations were determined in each patient as a measure for interhemispheric hippocampal coupling. On the group level a non-parametric Spearman correlation analysis was performed to assess relations of hippocampal connectivity to age, age at epilepsy onset, disease duration, and task performance.
In all except for one patient correlation coefficients between left and right hippocampal time courses reached significance. Interhippocampal connectivity exhibited the strongest correlation to age at onset, i.e. patients with later onset showed greater connectivity. It was negatively correlated with disease duration, but not with age.
Our findings underline the malicious effect of epileptic seizures on brain structures inevitably engaged with core cognitive functions. The results suggest that a measure of interhemispheric interplay â even at a coarse time-scale â might reflect the functional status of brain structures.},

Though random, the distribution of reaction times usually follows a relatively simple law, which in turn can be explained by the LATER model, in which a decision signal, representing belief in the existence of the target, rises in response to incoming sensory evidence from an initial value to a criterion level at which action is initiated. But the rate of rise fluctuates randomly from trial, to an extent that cannot be explained by sensory noise at the input. These conclusions, confirmed by recording from neurons in the frontal eye fields, suggest that the randomness of reaction time is due to a deliberate, gratuitous, neural process which confers certain biological advantages as well as having implications for general ideas about the nature of âfree will'.},

	abstract = {This paper considers agency in the setting of embodied or active inference. In brief, we associate a sense of agency with prior beliefs about action and ask what sorts of beliefs underlie optimal behavior. In particular, we consider prior beliefs that action minimizes the KullbackâLeibler (KL) divergence between desired states and attainable states in the future. This allows one to formulate bounded rationality as approximate Bayesian inference that optimizes a free energy bound on model evidence. We show that constructs like expected utility, exploration bonuses, softmax choice rules and optimism bias emerge as natural consequences of this formulation. Previous accounts of active inference have focused on predictive coding and Bayesian filtering schemes for minimizing free energy. Here, we consider variational Bayes as an alternative scheme that provides formal constraints on the computational anatomy of inference and actionâconstraints that are remarkably consistent with neuroanatomy. Furthermore, this scheme contextualizes optimal decision theory and economic (utilitarian) formulations as pure inference problems. For example, expected utility theory emerges as a special case of free energy minimization, where the sensitivity or inverse temperature (of softmax functions and quantal response equilibria) has a unique and Bayes-optimal solutionâthat minimizes free energy. This sensitivity corresponds to the precision of beliefs about behavior, such that attainable goals are afforded a higher precision or confidence. In turn, this means that optimal behavior entails a representation of confidence about outcomes that are under an agent's control.},

Instead, there is growing evidence that dopamine is involved in the formation of associations between salient contextual stimuli and internal rewarding or aversive events. This evidence suggests that dopaminergic-neuron activation aids the organism in learning to recognize stimuli associated with such events. Thus, mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons have an important function in the acquisition of behavior reinforced by natural reward and drug stimuli.

	abstract = {It should be apparent from this review that far less is known about the neural basis for inhalant abuse than for other forms of drug abuse. This reflects a lack of research interest in this area (Balster, 1997). Indeed, conclusions are difficult to draw. In the case of the volatile alkyl nitrites, the most reasonable hypothesis at this time is that the cellular basis for their abuse resides in their actions on smooth muscles to produce vasodilation and relaxation, however, direct effects on the brain cannot be ruled out. Although there is some evidence that analgesic effects of nitrous oxide may involve opiate systems, even this conclusion is controversial. There is no evidence that opiate systems play a role in nitrous oxide intoxication or reinforcement. The mechanisms for these effects are unknown. They may reflect the same actions on lipid membranes or on hydrophobic sites on unspecified proteins that have been proposed as mechanisms for nitrous oxide anesthesia. In the case of the volatile solvents, fuels and anesthetics we are faced with a wide variety of specific chemicals which may produce different profiles of pharmacological effects. There is evidence that the prototypic abused solvents toluene and trichloroethane produce acute effects similar to subanesthetic concentrations of general anesthetics, as well as to the effects of classical CNS depressant drugs, such as alcohol and the barbiturates. For the anesthetics, evidence suggests that enhancement of GABAergic inhibition may be an important cellular target for their acute effects, just as it is for alcohol and other depressant drugs. For toluene, as with alcohol, recent evidence suggests a possible role for inhibition of glutamatergic neurotransmission involving NMDA receptors. Toluene has also been shown to have some dopaminergic effects which may be important to its abuse. As for the large number of other abused vapors, practically no information can be found on their cellular actions, and certainly not on actions that may be relevant to their abuse. This entire area would seem an important direction for future research.},

	abstract = {The conceptualization of drug addiction as a compulsive disorder with excessive drug intake and loss of control over intake requires motivational mechanisms. Opponent process as a motivational theory for the negative reinforcement of drug dependence has long required a neurobiological explanation. Key neurochemical elements involved in reward and stress within basal forebrain structures involving the ventral striatum and extended amygdala are hypothesized to be dysregulated in addiction to convey the opponent motivational processes that drive dependence. Specific neurochemical elements in these structures include not only decreases in reward neurotransmission such as dopamine and opioid peptides in the ventral striatum, but also recruitment of brain stress systems such as corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), noradrenaline and dynorphin in the extended amygdala. Acute withdrawal from all major drugs of abuse produces increases in reward thresholds, anxiety-like responses and extracellular levels of CRF in the central nucleus of the amygdala. CRF receptor antagonists block excessive drug intake produced by dependence. A brain stress response system is hypothesized to be activated by acute excessive drug intake, to be sensitized during repeated withdrawal, to persist into protracted abstinence and to contribute to stress-induced relapse. The combination of loss of reward function and recruitment of brain stress systems provides a powerful neurochemical basis for the long hypothesized opponent motivational processes responsible for the negative reinforcement driving addiction.},

According to this hypothesis, a disease-defining experience (for example, drug reward or stress) would trigger specific forms of synaptic plasticity, which in susceptible subjects would become persistent and lead to the disease. While the notion of synaptic diseases has received much attention, no candidate disorder has been sufficiently investigated to yield new, rational therapies that could be tested in the clinic. Here we review the arguments in favor of abnormal neuronal plasticity underlying addiction and anxiety disorders, with a focus on the functional diversity of neurons that make up the circuits involved. We argue that future research must strive to obtain a comprehensive description of the relevant functional anatomy. This will allow identification of molecular mechanisms that govern the induction and expression of disease-relevant plasticity in identified neurons. To establish causality, one will have to test whether normalization of function can reverse pathological behavior. With these elements in hand, it will be possible to propose blueprints for manipulations to be tested in translational studies. The challenge is daunting, but new techniques, above all optogenetics, may enable decisive advances.},

Uncertainties exist about the prevalence and comorbidity of substance
use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders.Objective
To present nationally representative data on the prevalence and comorbidity
of DSM-IV alcohol and drug use disorders and independent
mood and anxiety disorders (including only those that are not substance induced
and that are not due to a general medical condition).Design
Face-to-face survey.Setting
The United States.Participants
Household and group quarters' residents.Main Outcome Measures
Prevalence and associations of substance use disorders and independent
mood and anxiety disorders.Results
The prevalences of 12-month DSM-IV independent
mood and anxiety disorders in the US population were 9.21\% (95\% confidence
interval [CI], 8.78\%-9.64\%) and 11.08\% (95\% CI, 10.43\%-11.73\%), respectively.
The rate of substance use disorders was 9.35\% (95\% CI, 8.86\%-9.84\%). Only
a few individuals with mood or anxiety disorders were classified as having
only substance-induced disorders. Associations between most substance use
disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders were positive and significant
(P{\textless}.05).Conclusions
Substance use disorders and mood and anxiety disorders that develop
independently of intoxication and withdrawal are among the most prevalent
psychiatric disorders in the United States. Associations between most substance
use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders were overwhelmingly
positive and significant, suggesting that treatment for a comorbid mood or
anxiety disorder should not be withheld from individuals with substance use
disorders.},

	abstract = {Drug addiction is a chronically relapsing disorder that has been characterized by (1) compulsion to seek and take the drug, (2) loss of control in limiting intake, and (3) emergence of a negative emotional state (eg, dysphoria, anxiety, irritability) reflecting a motivational withdrawal syndrome when access to the drug is prevented. Drug addiction has been conceptualized as a disorder that involves elements of both impulsivity and compulsivity that yield a composite addiction cycle composed of three stages: 'binge/intoxication', 'withdrawal/negative affect', and 'preoccupation/anticipation' (craving). Animal and human imaging studies have revealed discrete circuits that mediate the three stages of the addiction cycle with key elements of the ventral tegmental area and ventral striatum as a focal point for the binge/intoxication stage, a key role for the extended amygdala in the withdrawal/negative affect stage, and a key role in the preoccupation/anticipation stage for a widely distributed network involving the orbitofrontal cortex-dorsal striatum, prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, and insula involved in craving and the cingulate gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal, and inferior frontal cortices in disrupted inhibitory control. The transition to addiction involves neuroplasticity in all of these structures that may begin with changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system and a cascade of neuroadaptations from the ventral striatum to dorsal striatum and orbitofrontal cortex and eventually dysregulation of the prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and extended amygdala. The delineation of the neurocircuitry of the evolving stages of the addiction syndrome forms a heuristic basis for the search for the molecular, genetic, and neuropharmacological neuroadaptations that are key to vulnerability for developing and maintaining addiction.},

	abstract = {Objective
 Studies of the neurobiological processes underlying drug addiction primarily have focused on limbic subcortical structures. Here the authors evaluated the role of frontal cortical structures in drug addiction.

Method
 An integrated model of drug addiction that encompasses intoxication, bingeing, withdrawal, and craving is proposed. This model and findings from neuroimaging studies on the behavioral, cognitive, and emotional processes that are at the core of drug addiction were used to analyze the involvement of frontal structures in drug addiction.

Results
 The orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate gyrus, which are regions neuroanatomically connected with limbic structures, are the frontal cortical areas most frequently implicated in drug addiction. They are activated in addicted subjects during intoxication, craving, and bingeing, and they are deactivated during withdrawal. These regions are also involved in higher-order cognitive and motivational functions, such as the ability to track, update, and modulate the salience of a reinforcer as a function of context and expectation and the ability to control and inhibit prepotent responses.

Conclusions
 These results imply that addiction connotes cortically regulated cognitive and emotional processes, which result in the overvaluing of drug reinforcers, the undervaluing of alternative reinforcers, and deficits in inhibitory control for drug responses. These changes in addiction, which the authors call I-RISA (impaired response inhibition and salience attribution), expand the traditional concepts of drug dependence that emphasize limbic-regulated responses to pleasure and reward.},

In this review the authors explore how advances in neurobiology are approaching an understanding of the cellular and circuitry underpinnings of addiction, and they describe the novel pharmacotherapeutic targets emerging from this understanding.
METHOD: Findings from neuroimaging of addicts are integrated with cellular studies in animal models of drug seeking.
RESULTS: While dopamine is critical for acute reward and initiation of addiction, end-stage addiction results primarily from cellular adaptations in anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal glutamatergic projections to the nucleus accumbens. Pathophysiological plasticity in excitatory transmission reduces the capacity of the prefrontal cortex to initiate behaviors in response to biological rewards and to provide executive control over drug seeking. Simultaneously, the prefrontal cortex is hyperresponsive to stimuli predicting drug availability, resulting in supraphysiological glutamatergic drive in the nucleus accumbens, where excitatory synapses have a reduced capacity to regulate neurotransmission.
CONCLUSIONS: Cellular adaptations in prefrontal glutamatergic innervation of the accumbens promote the compulsive character of drug seeking in addicts by decreasing the value of natural rewards, diminishing cognitive control (choice), and enhancing glutamatergic drive in response to drug-associated stimuli.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to explore a new way of treating drug addiction by ablating the nucleus accumbens (NAC), which has a close relationship with drug-induced psychological dependence, using stereotactic surgery, blocking the mesocorticolimbic dopamine circuit, alleviating craving for drugs and lowering the relapse rate after detoxification. On the basis of animal experiments, stereotactic surgery was performed in 28 patients by making a lesion in the NAC bilaterally to treat opiate drug dependence. Indications, the criterion of therapeutic effect, treatment process and the therapeutic and safety evaluation index of the surgery were formulated particularly. The mean follow-up period was 15 months. Relapse has not occurred in 11 cases up till now. Drug-free time in these patients has been more than half a year in 4 cases (more than a year in 3 cases), and less than half a year in 7 cases. Relapse occurred in 15 cases after surgery. Drug-free time in these patients was more than half a year in 3 cases, between 1 month and half a year in 10 cases and less than 1 month in 2 cases. The therapeutic effect was excellent in 7 cases (26.9\%), good in 10 cases (38.5\%) and poor in 2 cases (7.7\%). Another 7 cases were still under investigation at the time of writing. Relapse rates after surgery were 7.7, 38.5 and 57.5\% within 1 month, between 1 month and half a year and after more than half a year, respectively. There were no common complications of surgery such as intracranial hematoma or infection in these patients after operation. Character type was changed slightly in 2 cases, and 4 cases suffered temporary memory loss, which did not affect their daily lives and learning function. They all recovered within 1 month. There were different degrees of effectiveness of treating drug addicts' psychological dependence by making lesions in the NAC bilaterally with stereotactic surgery. No particular complications occurred. The operation is safe and feasible. The mean follow-up time in this study was 15 months. The effectiveness was satisfactory. The relapse rate of drug addicts after detoxification was clearly reduced.},

In patients with bilateral tremor of extrapyramidal origin, who were resistant to drug therapy, the therapeutic protocol associated (1) a radiofrequency VIM thalamotomy for the most disabled side, and (2) a continuous VIM stimulation for the other side using stereotactically implanted electrodes, connected to subcutaneous stimulators. VIM thalamotomy relieved the tremor in all operated cases. Side effects were mild and regressive. VIM stimulation strongly decreased the tremor but failed to suppress it as completely as thalamotomy did. This was due in part to the fact that programmable stimulator frequency rate is limited to 130 Hz, while it appeared that the optimal stimulation frequency was 200 Hz.

Here we use a mouse model of delayed cue-associated cocaine seeking with ex vivo electrophysiology in optogenetically delineated circuits. We find that seeking correlates with rectifying AMPA (Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor transmission and a reduced AMPA/NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) ratio at medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to nucleus accumbens shell D1-receptor medium-sized spiny neurons (D1R-MSNs). In contrast, the AMPA/NMDA ratio increases at ventral hippocampus to D1R-MSNs. Optogenetic reversal of cocaine-evoked plasticity at both inputs abolishes seeking, whereas selective reversal at mPFC or ventral hippocampus synapses impairs response discrimination or reduces response vigour during seeking, respectively. Taken together, we describe how information integration in the nucleus accumbens is commandeered by cocaine at discrete synapses to allow relapse.

We found three types of neuron based on responses to odours and outcomes: approximately half of the neurons (type I, 52\%) showed phasic excitation after reward-predicting odours and rewards in a manner consistent with reward prediction error coding; the other half of neurons showed persistent activity during the delay between odour and outcome that was modulated positively (type II, 31\%) or negatively (type III, 18\%) by the value of outcomes. Whereas the activity of type I neurons was sensitive to actual outcomes (that is, when the reward was delivered as expected compared to when it was unexpectedly omitted), the activity of type II and type III neurons was determined predominantly by reward-predicting odours. We 'tagged' dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons with the light-sensitive protein channelrhodopsin-2 and identified them based on their responses to optical stimulation while recording. All identified dopaminergic neurons were of type I and all GABAergic neurons were of type II.

Therefore, the investigation of neural mechanisms underlying reward functions requires behavioral theories that can conceptualize the different effects of rewards on behavior. The scientific investigation of behavioral processes by animal learning theory and economic utility theory has produced a theoretical framework that can help to elucidate the neural correlates for reward functions in learning, goal-directed approach behavior, and decision making under uncertainty. Individual neurons can be studied in the reward systems of the brain, including dopamine neurons, orbitofrontal cortex, and striatum. The neural activity can be related to basic theoretical terms of reward and uncertainty, such as contiguity, contingency, prediction error, magnitude, probability, expected value, and variance.},

However, most evidence implicating VTA DA neurons in these functions is based on indirect electrophysiological characterization, rather than cytochemical identification. These physiological criteria were first established in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), but their validity in the VTA is uncertain. In the current study we found that while 88 Â± 2\% of SNc neurons labelled by the neuronal marker NeuN were co-labelled for the catecholamine enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a much smaller percentage (55 Â± 2\%) of VTA neurons co-expressed TH. In addition, using in vitro whole-cell recordings we found that widely accepted physiological criteria for VTA DA neurons, including the hyperpolarization-activated inwardly rectifying non-specific cation current (Ih), spike duration, and inhibition by DA D2 receptor agonists, do not reliably predict the DA content of VTA neurons. We could not distinguish DA neurons from other VTA neurons by size, shape, input resistance, Ih size, or spontaneous firing rate. Although the absence of an Ih reliably predicted that a VTA neuron was non-dopaminergic, and Ih(â) neurons differ from Ih(+) neurons in firing rate, interspike interval (ISI) standard deviation, and ISI skew, no physiological property examined here is both sensitive and selective for DA neurons in the VTA. We conclude that reliable physiological criteria for VTA DA neuron identification have yet to be determined, and that the criteria currently being used are unreliable.},

By adding a noncompensable drug-induced dopamine increase to a TDRL model, a computational model of addiction is constructed that over-selects actions leading to drug receipt.

But does the entire medial shell generate reward hedonic impact? Or is there a specific localized site for opioid enhancement of hedonic "liking" in the medial shell? And how does enhanced taste hedonic impact relate to opioid-stimulated increases in food intake? Here, we used a functional mapping procedure based on microinjection Fos plumes to localize opioid substrates in the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens that cause enhanced "liking" reactions to sweet pleasure and that stimulate food intake. We mapped changes in affective orofacial reactions of "liking"/"disliking" elicited by sucrose or quinine tastes after D-Ala2-N-Me-Phe4-Glycol5-enkephalin (DAMGO) microinjections in rats and compared hedonic increases to food intake stimulated at the same sites. Our maps indicate that opioid-induced increases in sucrose hedonic impact are generated by a localized cubic millimeter site in a rostrodorsal region of the medial shell. In contrast, all regions of the medial shell generated DAMGO-induced robust increases in eating behavior and food intake. Thus, our results identify a locus for opioid amplification of hedonic impact and reveal a distinction between opioid mechanisms of food intake and hedonic impact. Opioid circuits for stimulating food intake are widely distributed, whereas hedonic "liking" circuits are more tightly localized in the rostromedial shell of the nucleus accumbens.},

Rats learned that a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS+1 tone) predicted a second conditioned stimulus (CS+2 feeder click) followed by an unconditioned stimulus (UCS sucrose reward). Some rats were sensitized to amphetamine after training. Electrophysiological activity of ventral pallidal neurons to stimuli was later recorded under the influence of vehicle or acute amphetamine injection. Both sensitization and acute amphetamine increased ventral pallidum firing at CS+2 (population code and rate code). There were no changes at CS+1 and minimal changes to UCS. With a new 'Profile Analysis', we show that mesolimbic activation by sensitization/amphetamine incrementally shifted neuronal firing profiles away from prediction signal coding (maximal at CS+1) and toward incentive coding (maximal at CS+2), without changing hedonic impact coding (maximal at UCS). This pattern suggests mesolimbic activation specifically amplifies a motivational transform of CS+ predictive information into incentive salience coded by ventral pallidal neurons. Our results support incentive-sensitization predictions and suggest why cues temporally proximal to drug presentation may precipitate cue-triggered relapse in human addicts.},

	abstract = {Microinjection of opioid agonists, such as morphine, into the nucleus accumbens shell produces increases in eating behavior (i.e. 'wanting' for food). This study (1) reports direct evidence that activation of accumbens opioid receptors in rats also augments food 'liking', or the hedonic impact of taste, and (2) identified a neural site that definitely contains receptors capable of increasing food intake. Morphine microinjections (0.5 microgram) into accumbens shell, which caused rats to increase eating, were found also to cause selective increases in positive hedonic patterns of behavioral affective reaction elicited by oral sucrose, using the 'taste reactivity' test of hedonic palatability. This positive shift indicated that morphine microinjections enhanced the hedonic impact of food palatability. The accumbens site mediating morphine-induced increases in food 'wanting' and 'liking' was identified using a novel method based on local expression of Fos induced directly by drug microinjections. The plume-shaped region of drug-induced increase in Fos immunoreactivity immediately surrounding a morphine microinjection site (Fos plume) was objectively mapped. A point-sampling procedure was used to measure the shape and size of 'positive' plumes of Fos expression triggered by microinjections of morphine at locations that caused increases in eating behavior. This revealed a functionally 'positive' neural region, containing receptors directly activated by behaviorally-effective drug microinjections. A subtraction mapping procedure was then used to eliminate all surrounding regions containing any 'negative' Fos plumes that failed to increase food intake. The subtraction produced a conservative map of the positive site, by eliminating regions that gave mixed effects, and leaving only a positive region that must contain receptors capable of mediating increases in food intake. The resulting mapped 'opioid eating site' was contained primarily within the medial caudal subregion of the nucleus accumbens shell, and did not substantially penetrate either into the accumbens core or into other subregions of the shell. Several other structures outside the nucleus accumbens (such as rostral ventral pallidum), immediately medial and adjacent to the shell, also appeared to be included in the functional site. Opioid receptors within this site thus are capable of mediating morphine-induced increases in eating, in part by enhancing the hedonic reward properties of food.},

The book takes the reader from everyday conceptions of pleasure and emotion through to the latest insights into the nature and functions of emotions at the interface of psychology and neuroscience, before exploring topics such as the nature of subjective experience and future possibilities including emotions . Throughout, the book focuses on the principles of reward systems in the brain and its links with mainstream psychology, helping the reader to understand the function and nature of emotion and pleasure, and its relevance to the rest of psychology. In addition, it also offers a clear understanding of fundamental topics such as the social emotions, individual emotions and the role of emotion and pleasure in decision making.

	issn = {0036-8075},
	abstract = {A given stimulus can induce a pleasant or unpleasant sensation depending on the subject's internal state. The word alliesthesia is proposed to describe this phenomenon. It is, in itself, an adequate motivation for behavior such as food intake or thermoregulation. Therefore, negative regulatory feedback systems, based upon oropharingeal or cutaneous thermal signals are peripheral only in appearance, since the motivational component of the sensation is of internal origin. The internal signals seem to be complex and related to the set points of some regulated variables of the "milieu interieur," like set internal temperature in the case of thermal sensation (15). Alliesthesia can therefore explain the adaptation of these behaviors to their goals. Only three sensations have been studied- thermal, gustatory, and olfactory, but it is probable that alliesthesia also exists in such simple ways as in bringing a signal, usually ignored, to the subject's attention. For example, gastric contractions, not normally perceived, are felt in the state of hunger (16). Since alliesthesia relies on an internal input, it is possible that alliesthesia exists only with sensations related to some constants of the "milieu interieur" and therefore would not exist in visual or auditory sensations. As a matter of fact, luminous or auditory stimuli can be pleasing or displeasing in themselves, but there seems to be little variation of pleasure in these sensations, that is, no alliesthesia. There may be some esthetic value linked to these stimuli but it is a striking coincidence that they are in themselves rather neutral and that it is difficult to imagine a constant of the "milieu interieur" which could be possibly modified by a visual or an auditive stimulus-such as light of a certain wavelength or sound of a given frequency. In the light of this theory, it is possible to reconsider the nature of the whole conscious experience. The existence of alliesthesia implies the presence of internal signals modifying the concious sensations aroused from peripheral receptors. It is therefore necessary to question the existence of sensations aroused by direct stimulation of central receptors, such as hypothalamic temperature detectors, osmoreceptors, and others. Does their excitation arouse sensations of their own, or does the sensation have to pass through peripheral senses? Only human experimentation could answer this question. In the same way, it is possible that selfstimulation of the brain is pleasant, not by giving a sensation in itself, but because the electrical stimulus (17), renders peripheral stimuli pleasant.},

	abstract = {How does the brain cause positive affective reactions to sensory pleasure? An answer to pleasure causation requires knowing not only which brain systems are activated by pleasant stimuli, but also which systems actually cause their positive affective properties. This paper focuses on brain causation of behavioral positive affective reactions to pleasant sensations, such as sweet tastes. Its goal is to understand how brain systems generate 'liking,' the core process that underlies sensory pleasure and causes positive affective reactions. Evidence suggests activity in a subcortical network involving portions of the nucleus accumbens shell, ventral pallidum, and brainstem causes 'liking' and positive affective reactions to sweet tastes. Lesions of ventral pallidum also impair normal sensory pleasure. Recent findings regarding this subcortical network's causation of core 'liking' reactions help clarify how the essence of a pleasure gloss gets added to mere sensation. The same subcortical 'liking' network, via connection to brain systems involved in explicit cognitive representations, may also in turn cause conscious experiences of sensory pleasure.},

Investigations aimed at determining the underlying basis for substance abuse have resulted in breakthroughs related to drug actions on normal neural processes; for example, the singular role of dopamine as the basis for drug addiction has been revised to include effects that, with other transmitter systems, produce changes in target neuronal firing that are different from those previously assumed, including "reward value" at the neuronal and systems levels and changes in the significance of pursued stimuli as a function of motivational state, context, effort, salience, and cognitive demand. Studies comparing these factors directly show differences between the actions of abused substances and less potent food-related rewards. Characterization of the change in reward-encoding processes for drug and natural rewards has provided insight into how abused substances gain control over behavior. This report explores how abused drugs alter neuron firing in reward-sensitive brain regions and how those alterations effect drug-seeking activity in animals and humans.},

The general health of the animals became markedly different: those self-administering heroin maintained grooming behavior, pretesting body weight, and a good state of general health; rats self-administering cocaine tended to cease grooming behavior, to lose up to 47\% of their pretesting body weight, and to show a pronounced deterioration in general health. The mortality rate for 30 days of continuous testing was 36\% for animals self-administering heroin and 90\% for those self-administering cocaine.

We dust off a several-decades-long debate about the relative importance of two forms of reinforcementâpositive reinforcement, subjectively linked to drug-induced euphoria, and negative reinforcement, subjectively linked to the alleviation of painâboth of which figure importantly in addiction theory; each of these forms has dominated addiction theory in its time. We agree that addiction begins with the formation of habits through positive reinforcement and that drug-opposite physiological responses often establish the conditions for negative reinforcement to come into play at a time when tolerance, in the form of increasing reward thresholds, appears to develop into positive reinforcement. Wiseâs work has tended to focus on positive-reinforcement mechanisms that are important for establishing drug-seeking habits and reinstating them quickly after periods of abstinence, whereas Koobâs work has tended to focus on the negative-reinforcement mechanisms that become most obvious in the late stages of sustained addiction. While we tend to agree with each other about the early and late stages of addiction, we hold different views as to (i) the point between early and late at which the diagnosis of âaddictionâ should be invoked, (ii) the relative importance of positive and negative reinforcement leading up to this transition, and (iii) the degree to which the specifics of negative reinforcement can be generalized across the range of addictive agents.},

Here, we selectively stimulated the three major subtypes of opioid receptors via agonist microinjections [mu (DAMGO), delta (DPDPE), or kappa (U50488H)] and constructed anatomical maps for functional localizations of consequent changes in hedonic âlikingâ (assessed by affective orofacial reactions to sucrose taste) versus âwantingâ (assessed by changes in food intake). Results indicated that the NAc rostrodorsal quadrant contains a shared opioid hedonic hotspot that similarly mediates enhancements of sucrose âlikingâ for mu, delta, and kappa stimulations. Within the rostrodorsal hotspot boundaries each type of stimulation generated at least a doubling or higher enhancement of hedonic reactions, with comparable intensities for all three types of opioid stimulation. By contrast, a negative hedonic coldspot was mapped in the caudal half of medial shell, where all three types of opioid stimulation suppressed âlikingâ reactions to approximately one-half normal levels. Different anatomical patterns were produced for stimulation of food âwantingâ, reflected in food intake. Altogether, these results indicate that the rostrodorsal hotspot in medial shell is unique for generating opioid-induced hedonic enhancement, and add delta and kappa signals to mu as hedonic generators within the hotspot. Also, the identification of a separable NAc caudal coldspot for hedonic suppression, and separate NAc opioid mechanisms for controlling food âlikingâ versus âwantingâ further highlights NAc anatomical heterogeneity and localizations of function within subregions of medial shell.},

Healthy undergraduates (n = 72) viewed previously validated and standardized video clips to induce boredom, sadness, and a neutral affective state, while their heart rate (HR), skin conductance levels (SCL), and cortisol levels were measured. Boredom yielded dynamic psychophysiological responses that differed from the other emotional states. Of particular interest, the physiological signature of boredom relative to sadness was characterized by rising HR, decreased SCL, and increased cortisol levels. This pattern of results suggests that boredom may be associated with both increased arousal and difficulties with sustained attention.

Exploring alternate goals and experiences allows the attainment of goals that might be missed if people fail to reengage. Similar to other discrete emotions, we propose that boredom has specific and unique impacts on behavior, cognition, experience and physiology. Consistent with a broader argument that boredom encourages the behavioral pursuit of alternative goals, we argue that, while bored, attention to the current task is reduced, the experience of boredom is negative and aversive, and that boredom increases autonomic arousal to ready the pursuit of alternatives. By motivating desire for change from the current state, boredom increases opportunities to attain social, cognitive, emotional and experiential stimulation that could have been missed. We review the limited extant literature to support these claims, and call for more experimental boredom research.},

A recurrent puzzle raised by critics of these models is that biological systems do not seem to avoid surprises. We do not simply seek a dark, unchanging chamber, and stay there. This is the âDark-Room Problem.â Here, we describe the problem and further unpack the issues to which it speaks. Using the same format as the prolog of Eddingtonâs Space, Time, and Gravitation (Eddington, 1920) we present our discussion as a conversation between: an information theorist (Thornton), a physicist (Friston), and a philosopher (Clark).},

Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this "hierarchical prediction machine" approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual.

	abstract = {Predictive coding is a unifying framework for understanding redundancy reduction and efficient coding in the nervous system. By transmitting only the unpredicted portions of an incoming sensory signal, predictive coding allows the nervous system to reduce redundancy and make full use of the limited dynamic range of neurons. Starting with the hypothesis of efficient coding as a design principle in the sensory system, predictive coding provides a functional explanation for a range of neural responses and many aspects of brain organization. The lateral and temporal antagonism in receptive fields in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus occur naturally as a consequence of predictive coding of natural images. In the higher visual system, predictive coding provides an explanation for oriented receptive fields and contextual effects as well as the hierarchical reciprocally connected organization of the cortex. Predictive coding has also been found to be consistent with a variety of neurophysiological and psychophysical data obtained from different areas of the brain.

	abstract = {Interneurons exhibiting centre--surround antagonism within their receptive fields are commonly found in peripheral visual pathways. We propose that this organization enables the visual system to encode spatial detail in a manner that minimizes the deleterious effects of intrinsic noise, by exploiting the spatial correlation that exists within natural scenes. The antagonistic surround takes a weighted mean of the signals in neighbouring receptors to generate a statistical prediction of the signal at the centre. The predicted value is subtracted from the actual centre signal, thus minimizing the range of outputs transmitted by the centre. In this way the entire dynamic range of the interneuron can be devoted to encoding a small range of intensities, thus rendering fine detail detectable against intrinsic noise injected at later stages in processing. This predictive encoding scheme also reduces spatial redundancy, thereby enabling the array of interneurons to transmit a larger number of distinguishable images, taking into account the expected structure of the visual world. The profile of the required inhibitory field is derived from statistical estimation theory. This profile depends strongly upon the signal: noise ratio and weakly upon the extent of lateral spatial correlation. The receptive fields that are quantitatively predicted by the theory resemble those of X-type retinal ganglion cells and show that the inhibitory surround should become weaker and more diffuse at low intensities. The latter property is unequivocally demonstrated in the first-order interneurons of the fly's compound eye. The theory is extended to the time domain to account for the phasic responses of fly interneurons. These comparisons suggest that, in the early stages of processing, the visual system is concerned primarily with coding the visual image to protect against subsequent intrinsic noise, rather than with reconstructing the scene or extracting specific features from it. The treatment emphasizes that a neuron's dynamic range should be matched to both its receptive field and the statistical properties of the visual pattern expected within this field. Finally, the analysis is synthetic because it is an extension of the background suppression hypothesis (Barlow \& Levick 1976), satisfies the redundancy reduction hypothesis (Barlow 1961 a, b) and is equivalent to deblurring under certain conditions (Ratliff 1965).},

Can we now judge whether there is anything in this idea, and can we see where it should direct our thinking? This paper argues that the original hypothesis was wrong in over-emphasizing the role of compressive coding and economy in neuron numbers, but right in drawing attention to the importance of redundancy. Furthermore there is a clear direction in which it now points, namely to the overwhelming importance of probabilities and statistics in neuroscience. The brain has to decide upon actions in a competitive, chance-driven world, and to do this well it must know about and exploit the non-random probabilities and interdependences of objects and events signalled by sensory messages. These are particularly relevant for Bayesian calculations of the optimum course of action. Instead of thinking of neural representations as transformations of stimulus energies, we should regard them as approximate estimates of the probable truths of hypotheses about the current environment, for these are the quantities required by a probabilistic brain working on Bayesian principles.},

Here we suggest that the function of the mirror system can be understood within a predictive coding framework that appeals to the statistical approach known as empirical Bayes. Within this scheme the most likely cause of an observed action can be inferred by minimizing the prediction error at all levels of the cortical hierarchy that are engaged during action observation.

From this perspective, it is easy to justify an incremental variant of the EM algorithm in which the distribution for only one of the unobserved variables is recalculated in each E step. This variant is shown empirically to give faster convergence in a mixture estimation problem. A variant of the algorithm that exploits sparse conditional distributions is also described, and a wide range of other variant algorithms are also seen to be possible. 1.

This leads to the "Bayesian coding hypothesis": that the brain represents sensory information probabilistically, in the form of probability distributions. Several computational schemes have recently been proposed for how this might be achieved in populations of neurons. Neurophysiological data on the hypothesis, however, is almost non-existent. A major challenge for neuroscientists is to test these ideas experimentally, and so determine whether and how neurons code information about sensory uncertainty.},

We aimed to study the neural processing of emotion-denoting words based on a circumplex model of affect, which posits that all emotions can be described as a linear combination of two neurophysiological dimensions, valence and arousal. Based on the circumplex model, we predicted a linear relationship between neural activity and incremental changes in these two affective dimensions.

Methods
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we assessed in 10 subjects the correlations of BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) signal with ratings of valence and arousal during the presentation of emotion-denoting words.

Results
Valence ratings correlated positively with neural activity in the left insular cortex and inversely with neural activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal and precuneus cortices. The absolute value of valence ratings (reflecting the positive and negative extremes of valence) correlated positively with neural activity in the left dorsolateral and medial pre-frontal cortex (PFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and right dorsal PFC, and inversely with neural activity in the left medial temporal cortex and right amygdala. Arousal ratings and neural activity correlated positively in the left parahippocampus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and inversely in the left dorsolateral PFC and dorsal cerebellum.

Conclusion
We found evidence for two neural networks subserving the affective dimensions of valence and arousal. These findings clarify inconsistencies from prior imaging studies of affect by suggesting that two underlying neurophysiological systems, valence and arousal, may subserve the processing of affective stimuli, consistent with the circumplex model of affect.},

It is fairly easy to show that making inferences about the causes of sensory data can be cast as the minimization of a free-energy bound on the likelihood of sensory inputs, given an internal model of how they were caused. In this article, we consider what would happen if the data themselves were sampled to minimize this bound. It transpires that the ensuing active sampling or inference is mandated by ergodic arguments based on the very existence of adaptive agents. Furthermore, it accounts for many aspects of motor behavior; from retinal stabilization to goal-seeking. In particular, it suggests that motor control can be understood as fulfilling prior expectations about proprioceptive sensations. This formulation can explain why adaptive behavior emerges in biological agents and suggests a simple alternative to optimal control theory. We illustrate these points using simulations of oculomotor control and then apply to same principles to cued and goal-directed movements. In short, the free-energy formulation may provide an alternative perspective on the motor control that places it in an intimate relationship with perception.},

Here we discuss the potential of this model in explaining the mechanisms underlying aesthetic experiences. Traditionally art appreciation has been associated with concepts such as harmony, perceptual fluency, and the so-called good Gestalt. We observe that more often than not great artworks blatantly violate these characteristics. Using the concept of prediction error from the predictive coding approach, we attempt to resolve this contradiction. We argue that artists often destroy predictions that they have first carefully built up in their viewers, and thus highlight the importance of negative affect in aesthetic experience. However, the viewer often succeeds in recovering the predictable pattern, sometimes on a different level. The ensuing rewarding effect is derived from this transition from a state of uncertainty to a state of increased predictability. We illustrate our account with several example paintings and with a discussion of art movements and individual differences in preference. On a more fundamental level, our theorizing leads us to consider the affective implications of prediction confirmation and violation. We compare our proposal to other influential theories on aesthetics and explore its advantages and limitations.},

This Review looks at some key brain theories in the biological (for example, neural Darwinism) and physical (for example, information theory and optimal control theory) sciences from the free-energy perspective. Crucially, one key theme runs through each of these theories ? optimization. Furthermore, if we look closely at what is optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error, expected cost). This is the quantity that is optimized under the free-energy principle, which suggests that several global brain theories might be unified within a free-energy framework.},

	shorttitle = {Aging gracefully},
	abstract = {Whereas some older adults show significant cognitive deficits, others perform as well as young adults. We investigated the neural basis of these different aging patterns using positron emission tomography (PET). In PET and functional MRI (fMRI) studies, prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity tends to be less asymmetric in older than in younger adults (Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Old Adults or HAROLD). This change may help counteract age-related neurocognitive decline (compensation hypothesis) or it may reflect an age-related difficulty in recruiting specialized neural mechanisms (dedifferentiation hypothesis). To compare these two hypotheses, we measured PFC activity in younger adults, low-performing older adults, and high-performing older adults during recall and source memory of recently studied words. Compared to recall, source memory was associated with right PFC activations in younger adults. Low-performing older adults recruited similar right PFC regions as young adults, but high-performing older adults engaged PFC regions bilaterally. Thus, consistent with the compensation hypothesis and inconsistent with the dedifferentiation hypothesis, a hemispheric asymmetry reduction was found in high-performing but not in low-performing older adults. The results suggest that low-performing older adults recruited a similar network as young adults but used it inefficiently, whereas high-performing older adults counteracted age-related neural decline through a plastic reorganization of neurocognitive networks.},

In the face of these decreases, functional imaging studies have demonstrated, somewhat surprisingly, reliable increases in prefrontal activation. To account for these joint phenomena, we propose the scaffolding theory of aging and cognition (STAC). STAC provides an integrative view of the aging mind, suggesting that pervasive increased frontal activation with age is a marker of an adaptive brain that engages in compensatory scaffolding in response to the challenges posed by declining neural structures and function. Scaffolding is a normal process present across the lifespan that involves use and development of complementary, alternative neural circuits to achieve a particular cognitive goal. Scaffolding is protective of cognitive function in the aging brain, and available evidence suggests that the ability to use this mechanism is strengthened by cognitive engagement, exercise, and low levels of default network engagement.},

However, most studies have focused on the default mode network and ignored other resting state networks. In this study, we measured resting state activity using fMRI and explored whether cognitive decline with aging is related to disrupted resting state networks. Independent component analysis was used to evaluate functional connectivity. Notably, the connectivity within the salience network that consisted of the bilateral insula and the anterior cingulated cortex decreased with aging; the impairment of functional connectivity was correlated with measured decreases in individual cognitive abilities. Furthermore, certain internetwork connectivities (salience to auditory, default mode to visual, etc.) also decreased with aging. These results suggest that (1) aging affects not only the default mode network but also other networks, specifically the salience network; (2) aging affects internetwork connectivity; and (3) disruption of the salience network is related to cognitive decline in elderly people.},

	abstract = {At rest, the brain's sensorimotor and higher cognitive systems engage in organized patterns of correlated activity forming resting-state networks. An important empirical question is how functional connectivity and structural connectivity within and between resting-state networks change with age. In this study we use network modeling techniques to identify significant changes in network organization across the human lifespan. The results of this study demonstrate that whole-brain functional and structural connectivity both exhibit reorganization with age. On average, functional connections within resting-state networks weaken in magnitude while connections between resting-state networks tend to increase. These changes can be localized to a small subset of functional connections that exhibit systematic changes across the lifespan. Collectively, changes in functional connectivity are also manifest at a system-wide level, as components of the control, default mode, saliency/ventral attention, dorsal attention, and visual networks become less functionally cohesive, as evidenced by decreased component modularity. Paralleling this functional reorganization is a decrease in the density and weight of anatomical white-matter connections. Hub regions are particularly affected by these changes, and the capacity of those regions to communicate with other regions exhibits a lifelong pattern of decline. Finally, the relationship between functional connectivity and structural connectivity also appears to change with age; functional connectivity along multi-step structural paths tends to be stronger in older subjects than in younger subjects. Overall, our analysis points to age-related changes in inter-regional communication unfolding within and between resting-state networks.},

	abstract = {The human brain undergoes both morphological and functional modifications across the human lifespan. It is important to understand the aspects of brain reorganization that are critical in normal aging. To address this question, one approach is to investigate age-related topological changes of the brain. In this study, we developed a brain network model using graph theory methods applied to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from two groups of normal healthy adults classified by age. We found that brain functional networks demonstrated modular organization in both groups with modularity decreased with aging, suggesting less distinct functional divisions across whole brain networks. Local efficiency was also decreased with aging but not with global efficiency. Besides these brain-wide observations, we also observed consistent alterations of network properties at the regional level in the elderly, particularly in two major functional networks-the default mode network (DMN) and the sensorimotor network. Specifically, we found that measures of regional strength, local and global efficiency of functional connectivity were increased in the sensorimotor network while decreased in the DMN with aging. These results indicate that global reorganization of brain functional networks may reflect overall topological changes with aging and that aging likely alters individual brain networks differently depending on the functional properties. Moreover, these findings highly correspond to the observation of decline in cognitive functions but maintenance of primary information processing in normal healthy aging, implying an underlying compensation mechanism evolving with aging to support higher-level cognitive functioning.},

Neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), allow the investigation of the neural bases of age-related cognitive changes in vivo. Typically, fMRI studies map brain activity while subjects perform cognitive tasks, but such paradigms are often difficult to implement on a wider basis. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has emerged as an important alternative modality of fMRI data acquisition, during which no specific task is required. Due to such simplicity and the reliability of rs-fMRI data, this modality presents increased feasibility and potential for clinical application in the future. With rs-fMRI, fluctuations in regional brain activity can be detected across separate brain regions and the patterns of intercorrelation between the functioning of these regions are measured, affording quantitative indices of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). This review article summarizes the results of recent rs-fMRI studies that have documented a variety of aging-related RSFC changes in the human brain, discusses the neurophysiological hypotheses proposed to interpret such findings, and provides an overview of the future, highly promising perspectives in this field.},

AD in particular is accompanied by widespread cortical neuronal loss, and loss of connections between brain systems. This degeneration of neural pathways disrupts the functional coherence of brain activation. Recent innovations in brain imaging have detected characteristic disruptions in functional networks. Here we review studies examining changes in functional connectivity, measured through fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), starting with healthy aging and then Alzheimer's disease. We cover studies that employ the three primary methods to analyze functional connectivity--seed-based, ICA (independent components analysis), and graph theory. At the end we include a brief discussion of other methodologies, such as EEG (electroencephalography), MEG (magnetoencephalography), and PET (positron emission tomography). We also describe multi-modal studies that combine rsfMRI (resting state fMRI) with PET imaging, as well as studies examining the effects of medications. Overall, connectivity and network integrity appear to decrease in healthy aging, but this decrease is accelerated in AD, with specific systems hit hardest, such as the default mode network (DMN). Functional connectivity is a relatively new topic of research, but it holds great promise in revealing how brain network dynamics change across the lifespan and in disease.},

Newman's modularity metric was maximised and topological roles were assigned to brain regions depending on their specific contributions to intra- and inter-modular connectivity. Both young and older brain networks demonstrated significantly non-random modularity. The young brain network was decomposed into 3 major modules: central and posterior modules, which comprised mainly nodes with few inter-modular connections, and a dorsal fronto-cingulo-parietal module, which comprised mainly nodes with extensive inter-modular connections. The mean network in the older group also included posterior, superior central and dorsal fronto-striato-thalamic modules but the number of intermodular connections to frontal modular regions was significantly reduced, whereas the number of connector nodes in posterior and central modules was increased.},

However, most investigations were performed using tasks involving reward processing or executive functions. Little is known about brain network abnormalities during task-free resting state in PG. In the present study, graph-theoretical methods were used to investigate network properties of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data in PG. We compared 19 patients with PG to 19 healthy controls (HCs) using the Graph Analysis Toolbox (GAT). None of the examined global metrics differed between groups. At the nodal level, pathological gambler showed a reduced clustering coefficient in the left paracingulate cortex and the left juxtapositional lobe (supplementary motor area, SMA), reduced local efficiency in the left SMA, as well as an increased node betweenness for the left and right paracingulate cortex and the left SMA. At an uncorrected threshold level, the node betweenness in the left inferior frontal gyrus was decreased and increased in the caudate. Additionally, increased functional connectivity between fronto-striatal regions and within frontal regions has also been found for the gambling patients. These findings suggest that regions associated with the reward system demonstrate reduced segregation but enhanced integration while regions associated with executive functions demonstrate reduced integration. The present study makes evident that PG is also associated with abnormalities in the topological network structure of the brain during rest. Since alterations in PG cannot be explained by direct effects of abused substances on the brain, these findings will be of relevance for understanding functional connectivity in other addictive disorders.},

The goal of this study was to extend such observations by investigating large-scale brain functional network correlates of cognitive-control performance in OCD patients. Experimental design: We combined fMRI with a validated task of cognitive control and a multivariate statistical method to assess multiple functional networks encompassing broad task-relevant cortical regions in OCD patients and matched controls. Functional networks of interest were targeted a priori and the groups were compared in terms of the spatiotemporal profile of network responses (functional connectivity) during the task performance in a data-driven manner. Principal observations: Task performance was equivalent in both groups and each distinct network demonstrated strong overlap in its general response during task. However, significant differences in functional connectivity were also observed between groups that appeared driven by specific phases of task performance. Such differences were most pronounced during rest-task transitions and mainly involved dorsal anterior cingulate and insular cortices within the paralimbic network. Relative heightened functional connectivity of insula in patients during task correlated with a measure of patients' state anxiety. Conclusions: Our findings provide a novel functional imaging characterization of brain network alterations associated with cognitive-control in OCD. Additionally, these findings raise questions about the role of patients' arousal states on the performance of cognitive imaging tasks that are otherwise assumed to be emotionally neutral.

Graph theoretical analysis using diffusion tensor imaging was used to assess injury-related differences in structural connectivity between 23 children (age 11â16 years) with mTBI and 20 age-matched children with isolated orthopedic injuries (OI) scanned within 96 h postinjury. The distribution of hub regions and the associations between alterations in regional network measures and symptom burden, as assessed by the postconcussion symptom scale score (PCSS), were also examined. In comparison to the OI group, the mTBI group was found to have significantly higher small-worldness, higher normalized clustering coefficients , higher normalized characteristic path length (Pâ=â0.007), higher modularity (Pâ=â0.0005), and lower global efficiency (Pâ{\textless}â0.0001). A series of hub regions in the mTBI group were found to have significant alterations in regional network measures including nodal degree, nodal clustering coefficient, and nodal between-ness centrality. Correlation analysis showed that PCSS total score acquired at the time of imaging was significantly associated with the nodal degree of two hubs, the superior frontal gyrus at orbital section and the middle frontal gyrus. These findings provide new evidence of acute white matter alteration at both global and regional network level following mTBI in children furthering our understanding of underlying mechanisms of acute neurological insult associated with mTBI.

	abstract = {Down Syndrome is the most common genetic cause for intellectual disability, yet the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in Down Syndrome is unknown. We compared fMRI scans of 15 individuals with Down Syndrome to 14 typically developing control subjects while they viewed 50 min of cartoon video clips. There was widespread increased synchrony between brain regions, with only a small subset of strong, distant connections showing underconnectivity in Down Syndrome. Brain regions showing negative correlations were less anticorrelated and were among the most strongly affected connections in the brain. Increased correlation was observed between all of the distributed brain networks studied, with the strongest internetwork correlation in subjects with the lowest performance IQ. A functional parcellation of the brain showed simplified network structure in Down Syndrome organized by local connectivity. Despite increased interregional synchrony, intersubject correlation to the cartoon stimuli was lower in Down Syndrome, indicating that increased synchrony had a temporal pattern that was not in response to environmental stimuli, but idiosyncratic to each Down Syndrome subject. Short-range, increased synchrony was not observed in a comparison sample of 447 autism vs. 517 control subjects from the Autism Brain Imaging Exchange (ABIDE) collection of resting state fMRI data, and increased internetwork synchrony was only observed between the default mode and attentional networks in autism. These findings suggest immature development of connectivity in Down Syndrome with impaired ability to integrate information from distant brain regions into coherent distributed networks.},

	abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) studies of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimerâs disease (AD) have begun to reveal abnormalities in large-scale memory and cognitive brain networks. Since the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system is a site of very early pathology in AD, a number of studies have focused on this region of the brain. Yet it is clear that other regions of the large-scale episodic memory network are affected early in the disease as well, and fMRI has begun to illuminate functional abnormalities in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices as well in MCI and AD. Besides predictable hypoactivation of brain regions as they accrue pathology and undergo atrophy, there are also areas of hyperactivation in brain memory and cognitive circuits, possibly representing attempted compensatory activity. Recent fMRI data in MCI and AD are beginning to reveal relationships between abnormalities of functional activity in the MTL memory system and in functionally connected brain regions, such as the precuneus. Additional work with âresting stateâ fMRI data is illuminating functional-anatomic brain circuits and their disruption by disease. As this work continues to mature, it will likely contribute to our understanding of fundamental memory processes in the human brain and how these are perturbed in memory disorders. We hope these insights will translate into the incorporation of measures of task-related brain function into diagnostic assessment or therapeutic monitoring, which will hopefully one day be useful for demonstrating beneficial effects of treatments being tested in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Low-frequency fluctuations in fMRI signal have been used to map several consistent resting state networks in the brain. Using the posterior cingulate cortex as a seed region, functional connectivity analyses have found not only positive correlations in the default mode network but negative correlations in another resting state network related to attentional processes. The interpretation is that the human brain is intrinsically organized into dynamic, anti-correlated functional networks. Global variations of the BOLD signal are often considered nuisance effects and are commonly removed using a general linear model (GLM) technique. This global signal regression method has been shown to introduce negative activation measures in standard fMRI analyses. The topic of this paper is whether such a correction technique could be the cause of anti-correlated resting state networks in functional connectivity analyses. Here we show that, after global signal regression, correlation values to a seed voxel must sum to a negative value. Simulations also show that small phase differences between regions can lead to spurious negative correlation values. A combination breath holding and visual task demonstrates that the relative phase of global and local signals can affect connectivity measures and that, experimentally, global signal regression leads to bell-shaped correlation value distributions, centred on zero. Finally, analyses of negatively correlated networks in resting state data show that global signal regression is most likely the cause of anti-correlations. These results call into question the interpretation of negatively correlated regions in the brain when using global signal regression as an initial processing step.},

	abstract = {Resting state studies of spontaneous fluctuations in the functional MRI (fMRI) blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal have shown great promise in mapping the brain's intrinsic, large-scale functional architecture. An important data preprocessing step used to enhance the quality of these observations has been removal of spontaneous BOLD fluctuations common to the whole brain (the so-called global signal). One reproducible consequence of global signal removal has been the finding that spontaneous BOLD fluctuations in the default mode network and an extended dorsal attention system are consistently anticorrelated, a relationship that these two systems exhibit during task performance. The dependence of these resting-state anticorrelations on global signal removal has raised important questions regarding the nature of the global signal, the validity of global signal removal, and the appropriate interpretation of observed anticorrelated brain networks. In this study, we investigate several properties of the global signal and find that it is, indeed, global, not residing preferentially in systems exhibiting anticorrelations. We detail the influence of global signal removal on resting state correlation maps both mathematically and empirically, showing an enhancement in detection of system-specific correlations and improvement in the correspondence between resting-state correlations and anatomy. Finally, we show that several characteristics of anticorrelated networks including their spatial distribution, cross-subject consistency, presence with modified whole brain masks, and existence before global regression are not attributable to global signal removal and therefore suggest a biological basis.},

We employed resting-state functional MRI and graph-theory approaches to systematically chart the lifespan trajectory of the topological organization of human whole-brain functional networks in 126 healthy individuals ranging in age from 7 to 85 years. Brain networks were constructed by computing Pearson's correlations in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent temporal fluctuations among 1024 parcellation units followed by graph-based network analyses. We observed that the human brain functional connectome exhibited highly preserved non-random modular and rich club organization over the entire age range studied. Further quantitative analyses revealed linear decreases in modularity and inverted-U shaped trajectories of local efficiency and rich club architecture. Regionally heterogeneous age effects were mainly located in several hubs (e.g., default network, dorsal attention regions). Finally, we observed inverse trajectories of long- and short-distance functional connections, indicating that the reorganization of connectivity concentrates and distributes the brain's functional networks. Our results demonstrate topological changes in the whole-brain functional connectome across nearly the entire human lifespan, providing insights into the neural substrates underlying individual variations in behavior and cognition. These results have important implications for disease connectomics because they provide a baseline for evaluating network impairments in age-related neuropsychiatric disorders.},

Functional connectivity in young and older participants was assessed during resting-state fMRI. The results show that aging has a large impact, not only on connectivity within functional networks but also on connectivity between the different functional networks in the brain. Brain networks in the elderly showed decreased modularity (less distinct functional networks) and decreased local efficiency. Connectivity decreased with age within networks supporting higher level cognitive functions, that is, within the default mode, cingulo-opercular and fronto-parietal control networks. Conversely, no changes in connectivity within the somatomotor and visual networks, networks implicated in primary information processing, were observed. Connectivity between these networks even increased with age. A brain-wide analysis approach of functional connectivity in the aging brain thus seems fundamental in understanding how age affects integration of information.},

It has been suggested that the free energy principle precludes novelty and complexity, because it assumes that biological systems?like ourselves?try to minimize the long-term average of surprise to maintain their homeostasis. However, recent formulations show that minimizing surprise leads naturally to concepts such as exploration and novelty bonuses. In this approach, agents infer a policy that minimizes surprise by minimizing the difference (or relative entropy) between likely and desired outcomes, which involves both pursuing the goal-state that has the highest expected utility (often termed ?exploitation?) and visiting a number of different goal-states (?exploration?). Crucially, the opportunity to visit new states increases the value of the current state. Casting decision-making problems within a variational framework, therefore, predicts that our behavior is governed by both the entropy and expected utility of future states. This dissolves any dialectic between minimizing surprise and exploration or novelty seeking.},

	abstract = {This article concerns the nature of evoked brain responses and the principles underlying their generation. We start with the premise that the sensory brain has evolved to represent or infer the causes of changes in its sensory inputs. The problem of inference is well formulated in statistical terms. The statistical fundaments of inference may therefore afford important constraints on neuronal implementation. By formulating the original ideas of Helmholtz on perception, in terms of modern-day statistical theories, one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts.It turns out that the problems of inferring the causes of sensory input (perceptual inference) and learning the relationship between input and cause (perceptual learning) can be resolved using exactly the same principle. Specifically, both inference and learning rest on minimizing the brain's free energy, as defined in statistical physics. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. Cortical responses can be seen as the brain's attempt to minimize the free energy induced by a stimulus and thereby encode the most likely cause of that stimulus. Similarly, learning emerges from changes in synaptic efficacy that minimize the free energy, averaged over all stimuli encountered. The underlying scheme rests on empirical Bayes and hierarchical models of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of cortical organization and responses. The aim of this article is to encompass many apparently unrelated anatomical, physiological and psychophysical attributes of the brain within a single theoretical perspective. In terms of cortical architectures, the theoretical treatment predicts that sensory cortex should be arranged hierarchically, that connections should be reciprocal and that forward and backward connections should show a functional asymmetry (forward connections are driving, whereas backward connections are both driving and modulatory). In terms of synaptic physiology, it predicts associative plasticity and, for dynamic models, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. In terms of electrophysiology, it accounts for classical and extra classical receptive field effects and long-latency or endogenous components of evoked cortical responses. It predicts the attenuation of responses encoding prediction error with perceptual learning and explains many phenomena such as repetition suppression, mismatch negativity ({MMN}) and the P300 in electroencephalography. In psychophysical terms, it accounts for the behavioural correlates of these physiological phenomena, for example, priming and global precedence. The final focus of this article is on perceptual learning as measured with the {MMN} and the implications for empirical studies of coupling among cortical areas using evoked sensory responses.},

	abstract = {Recent models of hippocampal function have emphasized its role in relational binding ? the ability to form lasting representations regarding the relations among distinct elements or items which can support memory performance, even over brief delays (e.g., several seconds). The present study examined the extent to which aging is associated with changes in the recruitment of oscillatory activity within hippocampal and neocortical regions to support relational binding performance on a short delay visuospatial memory task. Structural magnetic resonance imaging and {MEG} were used to characterize potential age-related changes in hippocampal volume, oscillatory activity, and subsequent memory performance, and the relationships among them. Participants were required to bind the relative visuospatial positions of objects that were presented singly across time. Subsequently, the objects were re-presented simultaneously, and participants were required to indicate whether the relative spatial positions among the objects had been maintained. Older and younger adults demonstrated similar task accuracy, and older adults had preserved hippocampal volumes relative to younger adults. Age-group differences were found in pre-stimulus theta and beta oscillations, and this pre-stimulus activity was related to hippocampal volumes in younger adults. Age-group differences were also found in the recruitment of oscillatory activity from the pre-stimulus period to the task. Only younger adults showed a task-related change in theta (?5 Hz) power that was predictive of memory performance. In contrast, older adults demonstrated task-related alpha (?10 Hz) oscillatory power changes that were not observed in younger adults. These findings provide novel evidence for the role of the hippocampus and functionally connected regions in relational binding that is disrupted in aging. The present findings are discussed in the context of current models regarding the cognitive neuroscience of aging.},

Greater intracranial volume ({ICV}) has been associated with less severe Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) symptoms at a given level of cerebral pathology. In this study we examine whether {ICV} modulates the association between clinical disease progression on the one hand and brain atrophy or the apolipoprotein E genotype on the other.
Methods
Six hundred seventy-four subjects were studied from the {AD} Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI}). Subjects included 204 controls, 144 patients with {AD} dementia, and 326 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment ({aMCI}). Longitudinal analyses were conducted applying generalized estimating equations to examine the influence of {ICV} on clinical deterioration and atrophy progression. Follow-up data were available for up to 60 months after the baseline visit (mean 31.42 months, {SD} 13.12 months).
Results
{ICV} was not directly associated with clinical worsening or atrophy progression. However, {ICV} attenuated the impact of atrophy and the apolipoprotein E ?4 allele on clinical disease progression in {aMCI}.
Conclusion
Greater {ICV}, that is, premorbid brain size, seems to protect against clinical deterioration in the face of {AD}-related brain atrophy in {aMCI}. The results support the theory of a compensatory role of brain reserve in contrast to a neuroprotective role. The protective effects of morphologic reserve seem to be limited to early clinical {AD}; once a certain threshold of neurodegenerative burden is passed, a larger premorbid brain no longer offers an advantage in this context.},

A critical issue that still needs to be fully understood is the mechanism by which environmental enrichment interacts with brain plasticity to determine resilience to {AD} pathology. Previous work using {PET} suggests that increased brain connectivity might be at the origin of the compensatory mechanisms implicated in this process. This study aims to further clarify this issue using resting-state functional {MRI}. Resting-state functional {MRI} was collected for 11 patients with {AD}, 18 with mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}), and 16 healthy controls, and analyzed to isolate the default mode network ({DMN}). A quantitative score of {CR} was obtained by combining information about number of years of education and type of schools attended. Consistent with previous reports, education was found to modulate functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex, whose disconnection with the temporal lobes is known to be critical for the conversion from {MCI} to {AD}. This effect was highly significant in {AD} patients, less so in patients with {MCI}, and absent in healthy subjects. These findings show the potential neural mechanisms underlying the individual's ability to cope with brain damage, although they should be treated with some caution based on small numbers.},

Epidemiologic studies suggest that lifetime exposures including educational and occupational attainment, and leisure activities in late life, can increase this reserve. For example, there is a reduced risk of developinag Alzheimer's disease in individuals with higher educational or occupational attainment. It is convenient to think of two types of reserve: brain reserve, which refers to actual differences in the brain itself that may increase tolerance of pathology, and cognitive reserve. Cognitive reserve refers to individual differences in how tasks are performed that may allow some people to be more resilient than others.

Studies of the neurobiology of aging are beginning to decipher the mechanisms underlying not only the physiology of aging of the brain but also the mechanisms that make people more vulnerable to cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases. Today we know that the aging brain retains a considerable functional plasticity, and that this plasticity is positively promoted by genes activated by different lifestyle factors. In this article some of these lifestyle factors and their mechanisms of action are reviewed, including environmental enrichment and the importance of food intake and some nutrients. Aerobic physical exercise and reduction of chronic stress are also briefly reviewed. It is proposed that lifestyle factors are powerful instruments to promote healthy and successful aging of the brain and delay the appearance of age-related cognitive deficits in elderly people.},

Here, we summarize the main features of cognitive aging and their neuropathological correlates. We describe the neurobiology of cognitive aging and conclude that perturbations of neural health attributable to oxidative stress and inflammatory processes alone are insufficient to distinguish cognitive aging from Alzheimer's disease. We introduce the concept of cognitive reserve and illustrate its utility in explaining individual differences in cognitive aging. Structural and functional brain imaging studies suggest plausible neural substrates of cognitive reserve, probably involving processes that support neuroplasticity in the aging brain.

	abstract = {In order to understand the brain networks that mediate cognitive reserve, we explored the relationship between subjects' network expression during the performance of a memory test and an index of cognitive reserve. Using H2(15)O positron emission tomography, we imaged 17 healthy older subjects and 20 young adults while they performed a serial recognition memory task for nonsense shapes under two conditions: low demand, with a unique shape presented in each study trial; and titrated demand, with a study list size adjusted so that each subject recognized shapes at 75\% accuracy. A factor score that summarized years of education, and scores on the {NART} and the {WAIS}-R Vocabulary subtest was used as an index of cognitive reserve. The scaled subprofile model was used to identify a set of functionally connected regions (or topography) that changed in expression across the two task conditions and was differentially expressed by the young and elderly subjects. The regions most active in this topography consisted of right hippocampus, posterior insula, thalamus, and right and left operculum; we found concomitant deactivation in right lingual gyrus, inferior parietal lobe and association cortex, left posterior cingulate, and right and left calcarine cortex. Young subjects with higher cognitive reserve showed increased expression of the topography across the two task conditions. Because this topography, which is responsive to increased task demands, was differentially expressed as a function of reserve level, it may represent a neural manifestation of innate or acquired reserve. In contrast, older subjects with higher cognitive reserve showed decreased expression of the topography across tasks. This suggests some functional reorganization of the network used by the young subjects. Thus, for the old subjects this topography may represent an altered, compensatory network that is used to maintain function in the face of age-related physiological changes.},

A substantial proportion of nondemented, cognitively unimpaired elderly subjects show at least mild to moderate, and rarely even severe, Alzheimer-related lesions, probably representing asymptomatic preclinical Alzheimer's disease, and/or mixed pathologies. While the substrate of resilience to cognitive decline in the presence of abundant pathologies has been unclear, recent research has strengthened the concept of cognitive or brain reserve, based on neuroplasticity or the ability of the brain to manage or counteract age-related changes or pathologies by reorganizing its structure, connections, and functions via complex molecular pathways and mechanisms that are becoming increasingly better understood. Part of neuroplasticity is adult neurogenesis in specific areas of the brain, in particular the hippocampal formation important for memory function, the decline of which is common even in ?healthy? aging. To obtain further insights into the mechanisms of brain plasticity and adult neurogenesis, as the basis for prevention and potential therapeutic options, is a major challenge of modern neurosciences.},

Complimentarily, the cognitive reserve ({CR}) hypothesis emphasizes inter-individual differences in the effective recruitment of neural networks and cognitive processes to compensate for age-related effects or pathology. Despite an abundance of research, there is scarce literature attempting to synthesize the {BRC} the {CR} models.

Among healthy elders, higher {CR} was related to larger brains and reduced activity during cognitive processing, suggesting more effective use of cerebral networks. In contrast, higher {CR} was associated with reduced brain volumes in {MCI} and {AD} and increased brain function in the latter, indicating more advanced neuropathology but that active compensatory mechanisms are still at work in higher {CR} patients. The right superior temporal gyrus ({BA} 22) and the left superior parietal lobe ({BA} 7) showed greatest significant differences in direction of slope with {CR} and activation between controls and {AD} cases. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that {fMRI} patterns were more closely related to {CR} proxies than brain volumes.

We hypothesize that brain reserve may have neuroprotective effects against late life depression. Here, we discuss the modulatory capacity of stress and corticosteroid hormones on hippocampal plasticity and neuronal viability in late life depression as well as the anti-depressive of ketamine and scopolamine mediated by stimulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin, increased inhibitory phosphorylation of {GSK}-3?, and increased synaptogenesis. This review shall shed light on complex neurobiological mechanisms that underpin late life depression and help to better understand neural correlates of resilience. Investigating how rat models of increased cognitive reserve mitigate a chronic mild stress-elicited depression will afford new insights in the search for new therapeutic targets to treat this neuropsychiatric disorder.},

Behavioral results showed a similar pattern of emotional evaluation, but older adults experienced negatively valenced pictures as being less negative. Consistent with behavioral findings, we identified common activity in the right amygdala, but age-related differences in the functional connectivity of this region with the rest of the brain. Compared to young adults, older adults had greater functional connectivity between the right amygdala and ventral anterior cingulate cortex, possibly reflecting increased emotional regulation.

	abstract = {Recent work suggests that the default mode network ({DMN}) includes two core regions, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex ({PCC}), and several unique subsystems that are functionally distinct. These include a medial temporal lobe ({MTL}) subsystem, active during remembering and future projection, and a dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ({dmPFC}) subsystem, active during self-reference. The {PCC} has been further subdivided into ventral ({vPCC}) and dorsal ({dPCC}) regions that are more strongly connected with the {DMN} and cognitive control networks, respectively. The goal of this study was to examine age differences in resting state functional connectivity within these subsystems. After applying a rigorous procedure to reduce the effects of head motion, we used a multivariate technique to identify both common and unique patterns of functional connectivity in the {MTL} vs. the {dmPFC}, and in {vPCC} vs. {dPCC}. All four areas had robust functional connectivity with other {DMN} regions, and each also showed distinct connectivity patterns in both age groups. Young and older adults had equivalent functional connectivity in the {MTL} subsystem. Older adults showed weaker connectivity in the {vPCC} and {dmPFC} subsystems, particularly with other {DMN} areas, but stronger connectivity than younger adults in the {dPCC} subsystem, which included areas involved in cognitive control. Our data provide evidence for distinct subsystems involving {DMN} nodes, which are maintained with age. Nevertheless, there are age differences in the strength of functional connectivity within these subsystems, supporting prior evidence that {DMN} connectivity is particularly vulnerable to age, whereas connectivity involving cognitive control regions is relatively maintained. These results suggest an age difference in the integrated activity among brain networks that can have implications for cognition in older adults.},

Evidence shows an age-related decline in task-load-related modulation of the activity within the {DMN} during cognitive tasks. However, the effect of age on the functional coupling within the {DMN} and their relation to cognitive performance has hitherto been unexplored. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated functional connectivity within the {DMN} in older and younger subjects during a working memory task with increasing task load. Older adults showed decreased connectivity and ability to suppress low frequency oscillations of the {DMN}. Additionally, the strength of the functional coupling of posterior cingulate ({pCC}) with medial prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) correlated positively with performance and was lower in older adults. {pCC} was also negatively coupled with task-related regions, namely the dorsolateral {PFC} and cingulate regions. Our results show that in addition to changes in canonical task-related brain regions, normal aging is also associated with alterations in the activity and connectivity of brain regions within the {DMN}.

Furthermore, correlation reductions were severe in older adults free from Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) pathology as determined by amyloid imaging, suggesting that functional disruptions were not the result of {AD}.

	abstract = {The number of reports on the cognitive neuroscience of aging has increased in recent years, and most of these studies have found many similarities in the patterns of activity in young and old adults, indicating that basic neural mechanisms are maintained into older age. Despite these overall similarities, older adults often have less activity in some regions, such as medial temporal areas during memory processing and visual regions across a variety of cognitive domains. It seems clear that age reductions in cognitive function can be tied, at least in part, to these reductions in brain activity. On the other hand, older adults typically also overrecruit some brain areas, mainly the ventral or dorsal prefrontal cortex during memory tasks, as well as both the frontal and parietal regions during tasks engaging cognitive control processes, such as attention. Sometimes this overrecruitment appears to be in response to altered function in other brain regions and is often seen in those older adults who perform better on the task at hand. These findings have provided rather convincing support for the idea that overrecruitment can be compensatory in the elderly. Nevertheless, not all age increases can be interpreted as compensatory, and some are more indicative of neural inefficiency. The challenge facing future research will be to understand the task conditions that promote compensation in older adults, the role of the various brain areas in aiding cognitive function, and how these compensatory mechanisms can be elicited to enhance quality of life in the elderly.},

The significant differences between hypnosis and the baseline condition were observable (to different extent) in five studied independent frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). The results were consistent and stable after 1 year. Based on these findings we conclude that alteration in functional connectivity of the brain may be regarded as a neuronal correlate of hypnosis (at least in very highly hypnotizable subjects) in which separate cognitive modules and subsystems may be temporarily incapable of communicating with each other normally.},

The collective findings provide a gripping, albeit preliminary, account of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms involved in hypnotic phenomena. While substantial advances lend support to different hypotheses pertaining to hypnotic modulation of attention, control, and monitoring processes, the complex interactions among the many mediating variables largely hinder our ability to isolate robust commonalities across studies. The present account presents a critical integrative synthesis of neuroimaging studies targeting hypnosis as a function of suggestion. Specifically, hypnotic induction without task-specific suggestion is examined, as well as suggestions concerning sensation and perception, memory, and ideomotor response. The importance of carefully designed experiments is highlighted to better tease apart the neural correlates that subserve hypnotic phenomena. Moreover, converging findings intimate that hypnotic suggestions seem to induce specific neural patterns. These observations propose that suggestions may have the ability to target focal brain networks. Drawing on evidence spanning several technological modalities, neuroimaging studies of hypnosis pave the road to a more scientific understanding of a dramatic, yet largely evasive, domain of human behavior.},

The hypnotic procedure produced a modest increase in suggestibility when it was called 'relaxation,' but a very significant increase if it was labelled 'hypnosis.'

New England Journal of Medicine 352;7There is a wide variety of different types of epilepsy and seizures and a large array of available treatments suited to differing clinical situations. Consequently, the successful treatment of epilepsy is a complex process involving careful and rational analysis of a large number of variables and is rarely achieved. In recent years, there have been rapid advances both in medical and surgical treatments and and the complexity of treatment has increased still further. There remain important unresolved issues and controversies. Most of the existing large books on the subject either concentrate too much on the biology and phenomenology of epilepsy at the expense of therapy or else fail to balance the medical and surgical treatments available. This book aims to be the definitive textbook on medical and surgical treatment of epilepsy and to act as a clinical reference book with a strong practical bias. It will take the form of a detailed review and distillation of the literature rather than a presentation of individual research and will provide answers to the diversity of questions encountered in day to day clinical practice. In this way, the clinician will be guided through the difficult decision-making processes involved in the successful diagnosis and therapy.After a concise summary of the recent scientific developments in epileptology and discussion of the classification and diagnosis of epilepsy, the large medical will cover in detail the indications, clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and outcome of drug treatment.

We here review behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies of hypnosis as a state, as well as hypnosis as a tool to modulate brain responses to painful stimulations. Studies have shown that hypnotic processes modify internal (self awareness) as well as external (environmental awareness) brain networks. Brain mechanisms underlying the modulation of pain perception under hypnotic conditions involve cortical as well as subcortical areas including anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices, basal ganglia and thalami. Combined with local anesthesia and conscious sedation in patients undergoing surgery, hypnosis is associated with improved peri- and postoperative comfort of patients and surgeons. Finally, hypnosis can be considered as a useful analogue for simulating conversion and dissociation symptoms in healthy subjects, permitting better characterization of these challenging disorders by producing clinically similar experiences.},

In order to better determine the functional contribution of these networks to conscious awareness, we here sought to transiently modulate their relationship by means of hypnosis. We used independent component analysis ({ICA}) on resting state {fMRI} acquisitions during normal wakefulness, under hypnotic state, and during a control condition of autobiographical mental imagery. As compared to mental imagery, hypnosis-induced modulation of resting state {fMRI} networks resulted in a reduced "extrinsic" lateral frontoparietal cortical connectivity, possibly reflecting a decreased sensory awareness. The default mode network showed an increased connectivity in bilateral angular and middle frontal gyri, whereas its posterior midline and parahippocampal structures decreased their connectivity during hypnosis, supposedly related to an altered "self" awareness and posthypnotic amnesia. In our view, {fMRI} resting state studies of physiological (e.g., sleep or hypnosis), pharmacological (e.g., sedation or anesthesia), and pathological modulation (e.g., coma or related states) of "intrinsic" default mode and anticorrelated "extrinsic" sensory networks, and their interaction with other cerebral networks, will further improve our understanding of the neural correlates of subjective awareness.},

However, the experiential and cognitive correlates of {DMN} remain difficult to investigate directly. Using hypnosis as a means of altering the resting ("default") state in conjunction with subjective measures and brain imaging, the authors found that the state of attentional absorption following a hypnotic induction was associated with reduced activity in {DMN} and increased activity in prefrontal attentional systems, under invariant conditions of passive visual stimulation. The findings that hypnosis and spontaneous conceptual thought at rest were subjectively and neurally distinctive are also relevant to understanding hypnosis itself.},

Furthermore, highs had greater alpha power than lows during both prehypnosis and hypnosis conditions, demonstrating an association of alpha with hypnotic susceptibility.

It has been argued that the theory explains many essential aspects of intelligence including autonomous development, science, art, music, and humor. This overview first describes theoretically optimal (but not necessarily practical) ways of implementing the basic computational principles on exploratory, intrinsically motivated agents or robots, encouraging them to provoke event sequences exhibiting previously unknown, but learnable algorithmic regularities. Emphasis is put on the importance of limited computational resources for online prediction and compression. Discrete and continuous time formulations are given. Previous practical, but nonoptimal implementations (1991, 1995, and 1997-2002) are reviewed, as well as several recent variants by others (2005-2010).

In this paper, we address two important sets of anomalies, those having to do with generalization and novelty. Generalization responses are treated as the natural consequence of partial information; novelty responses are treated by the suggestion that dopamine cells multiplex information about reward bonuses, including exploration bonuses and shaping bonuses. We interpret this additional role for dopamine in terms of the mechanistic attentional and psychomotor effects of dopamine, having the computational role of guiding exploration.},

	abstract = {Exponential random graph models (ERGMs), also known as p* models, have been utilized extensively in the social science literature to study complex networks and how their global structure depends on underlying structural components. However, the literature on their use in biological networks (especially brain networks) has remained sparse. Descriptive models based on a specific feature of the graph (clustering coefficient, degree distribution, etc.) have dominated connectivity research in neuroscience. Corresponding generative models have been developed to reproduce one of these features. However, the complexity inherent in whole-brain network data necessitates the development and use of tools that allow the systematic exploration of several features simultaneously and how they interact to form the global network architecture. ERGMs provide a statistically principled approach to the assessment of how a set of interacting local brain network features gives rise to the global structure. We illustrate the utility of ERGMs for modeling, analyzing, and simulating complex whole-brain networks with network data from normal subjects. We also provide a foundation for the selection of important local features through the implementation and assessment of three selection approaches: a traditional p-value based backward selection approach, an information criterion approach (AIC), and a graphical goodness of fit (GOF) approach. The graphical GOF approach serves as the best method given the scientific interest in being able to capture and reproduce the structure of fitted brain networks.},

We discuss methods of approximate MLE and show that, though promising, simulation based methods pose difficulties in application because it is not known how much simulation is required. An alternative to simulation methods, maximum pseudolikelihood estimation (MPLE), is deterministic and has known asymptotic properties, but standard methods of assessing uncertainty with MPLE perform poorly. We introduce a resampling method that greatly outperforms the standard approach to characterizing uncertainty with MPLE. We also introduce ERGMs for dynamic networks?temporal ERGM (TERGM). In an application to modeling cosponsorship networks in the United States Senate, we show how recently proposed methods for dynamic network modeling can be integrated into the TERGM framework, and how our resampling method can be used to characterize uncertainty about network dynamics.},

	abstract = {The effect of inequality of variances on the two sided t-test is studied in this paper. It is found that there is no appreciable effect on the significance level even if the ratio of the variances differs from one by as much as 0.4. The effect starts showing when this difference exceeds 0.4. This effect is neutralized if one is permitted to take a larger number of observations from the population with the larger variance than from the population with the smaller variance. The effect on power is similar. Thus in the above circumstances one could safely use the t-test rather than switch to tests recommended for a Behrens-Fisher situation. Hsu (1938) has considered the effect of the inequality of variances on the significance level of the t-test and he has rejected that test for unequal sample sizes on the grounds that there is a large deviation in this significance level (see Scheffï¿½ (1959) for tabulated values). However, if the ratio of the variances is restricted, as is the case here, these large deviations are not obtained, and even the power is not appreciably affected. These results are extended to the multivariate situation. However, only the effect on significance level is considered. The distribution of Hotelling's \$T{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash}text\{-statistic\}\$ is derived when \${\textbackslash}Sigma \_\{1\}={\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}Sigma \_\{2\}\$ and is used to study the effect on the significance level. The results are similar to those of the univariate case and agrees with the Monte Carlo study of Holloway and Dunn (1967) and Hopkins and Clay (1963). That is, if the sample sizes are equal the significance level is not affected. However, it was found here that if the sample sizes are unequal then the larger sample should be taken from the population with the larger dispersion matrix. In this case we have a more conservative test procedure. Even when this is not the case if the dispersion matrices are not too unequal, that is if the ratio of the dispersion matrices is not less than 0.6, then the \$T{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash}text\{-test\}\$ procedure is still valid.},

	abstract = {Author Summary  Emotion plays a crucial role in the adaptation of humans and other animals to changes in their world. Nevertheless, emotion has been neglected in Bayesian models of learning in non-stationary environments. The free-energy principle has recently been proposed as a unified account of learning, perception and action in biological agents. In this paper, we propose a formal definition of emotional valence (i.e., the positive and negative character of emotion) in terms of the rate of change of free-energy or, under some simplifying assumptions, of prediction error over time. This formalization leads to a straightforward and simple meta-learning scheme that accounts for the complex and reciprocal interaction between cognition and emotion. We instantiate this scheme with an emotional agent who is able to dynamically assign emotional valence to every new state of the world that is visited and to experience basic forms of emotion. Crucially, our hypothetical agent uses emotional valence to dynamically adapt to unexpected changes in the world. The proposed scheme is very general in the sense that it is not tied to any particular generative model of sensory inputs.},

	issn = {0022-3077},
	abstract = {In this study, the representation of taste in the orbitofrontal cortex was investigated to determine whether or not a pleasant and an aversive taste have distinct or overlapping representations in this region. The pleasant stimulus used was sweet taste (1 M glucose), and the unpleasant stimulus was salt taste (0.1 M NaCl). We used an ON/OFF block design in a 3T fMRI scanner with a tasteless solution delivered in the OFF period to control for somatosensory or swallowing-related effects. It was found that parts of the orbitofrontal cortex were activated (P {\textless} 0.005 corrected) by glucose (in 6/7 subjects) and by salt (in 6/7 subjects). In the group analysis, separate areas of the orbitofrontal cortex were found to be activated by pleasant and aversive tastes. The involvement of the amygdala in the representation of pleasant as well as aversive tastes was also investigated. The amygdala was activated (region of interest analysis, P {\textless} 0.025 corrected) by the pleasant taste of glucose (5/7 subjects) as well as by the aversive taste of salt (4/7 subjects). Activation by both stimuli was also found in the frontal opercular/insular (primary) taste cortex. We conclude that the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in processing tastes that have both positive and negative affective valence and that different areas of the orbitofrontal cortex may be activated by pleasant and unpleasant tastes. We also conclude that the amygdala is activated not only by an affectively unpleasant taste, but also by a taste that is affectively pleasant, thus providing evidence that the amygdala is involved in effects produced by positively affective as well as by negatively affective stimuli.},

In this paper, applying a newly developed production theory, we discuss how discount rate is related to other factors in social systems, such as risk, duration of production, fixed cost in production and market size. The relations among different factors in a social system put constraints on the ranges of discount rate that are viable in particular environments. Our findings have strong policy implications. In a world of increasing cost of extracting natural resources, the continuation of low discount rate policy will generate wide gyration of social systems that we have witnessed in recent years.},

These choices range from the prosaic--how much food to eat at a meal--to life-changing decisions about education, marriage, fertility, health behaviors and savings. Intertemporal preferences also affect policy debates about long-run challenges, such as global warming. Historically, it was assumed that delayed rewards were discounted at a constant rate over time. Recent theoretical and empirical advances from economic, psychological and neuroscience perspectives, however, have revealed a more complex account of how individuals make intertemporal decisions. We review and integrate these advances. We emphasize three different, occasionally competing, mechanisms that are implemented in the brain: representation, anticipation and self-control.},

It is motivated by the view that there is more to economics than general equilibrium theory, and that the philosophy of economics should reflect the diversity of activities and topics that currently occupy economists. Contributions in the Handbook are thus closely tied to ongoing theoretical and empirical concerns in economics.   Contributors include both philosophers of science and economists. Chapters fall into three general categories: received views in philosophy of economics, ongoing controversies in microeconomics, and issues in modeling, macroeconomics, and development. Specific topics include methodology, game theory, experimental economics, behavioral economics, neuroeconomics, computational economics, data mining, interpersonal comparisons of utility, measurement of welfare and well being, growth theory and development, and microfoundations of macroeconomics.   The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Economics is a groundbreaking reference like no other in its field. It is a central resource for those wishing to learn about the philosophy of economics, and for those who actively engage in the discipline, from advanced undergraduates to professional philosophers, economists, and historians.},

Computational models derived from single-unit recordings capture changes in dopaminergic neuron firing rate as a prediction error signal. These models employ the prediction error signal in two roles: learning to predict future rewarding events and biasing action choice. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition or lesion of dopaminergic neuron function diminishes the ability of an animal to motivate behaviors directed at acquiring rewards. These lesion experiments have raised the possibility that dopamine release encodes a measure of the incentive value of a contemplated behavioral act. The most complete psychological idea that captures this notion frames the dopamine signal as carrying 'incentive salience'. On the surface, these two competing accounts of dopamine function seem incommensurate. To the contrary, we demonstrate that both of these functions can be captured in a single computational model of the involvement of dopamine in reward prediction for the purpose of reward seeking.},

In some of these cells the ionic conductances responsible for their excitability also endow them with autorhythmic electrical oscillatory properties. Chemical or electrical synaptic contacts between these neurons often result in network oscillations. In such networks, autorhythmic neurons may act as true oscillators (as pacemakers) or as resonators (responding preferentially to certain firing frequencies). Oscillations and resonance in the CNS are proposed to have diverse functional roles, such as (i) determining global functional states (for example, sleep-wakefulness or attention), (ii) timing in motor coordination, and (iii) specifying connectivity during development. Also, oscillation, especially in the thalamo-cortical circuits, may be related to certain neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review proposes that the autorhythmic electrical properties of central neurons and their connectivity form the basis for an intrinsic functional coordinate system that provides internal context to sensory input.},
